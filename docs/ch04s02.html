(Standard Generalised Markup Language). SGML is a meta-language, which
describes how markup languages are defined. Unlike HTML, SGML does not
consists of any predefined elements or  semantic rules, but are
strictly used to define markup languages of which HTML is the most
popular. But where HTML also contains tags, which describes font-size,
color etc. Meta-Markup languages consists of elements, that only are
used to the describe the logical structure of a document. In the
documentation domain these elements could be elements, like chapter,
sections, paragraphs, unnumbered lists etc.</p><p>One solution, could be to look elsewhere in NATO. During the 2nd
meeting in the XML Ad-Hoc Group, NAMSA presented a solution to the
problem of managing huge amounts of documentation by using a homegrown
document format. Although I could have chosen a similar approach, I
decided, that the proper way would be to use a format that already
enjoys considerably support from miscellaneous publishing
houses.</p><p>One popular SGML implementation is the markup language DocBook,
which is very well suited for technical documentation. There is one
strong argument against adopting the markup language to mark-up the
NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles. Although SGML has been around for quite a
while, and is very well suited for handling huge repositories of
technical documentation, the tools for editing and validating SGML
documents are very complicated and therefore also very expensive.
However, just a couple of weeks before the NOSWG meeting, OASIS
released a XML version of DocBook. Since XML is much less complicated
than SGML, it is very likely, that inexpensive tools for editing XML
documents will be available to the public, within a relative short
time frame.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch04.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch04s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 4. Introduction </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 4.3. Parser's and other tools</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
