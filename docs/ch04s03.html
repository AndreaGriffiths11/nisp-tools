quite a complicated affair. Releases are frequent, and new and not so
mature tools arrive every day. Fortunately, most of the tools
necessary for the translation of the NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles, are quite stable, and
require almost none if any post-processing by the user. When working
with a platform-independent technology such as XML, it can simplify
matter a lot, if the tools used would also be platform
independent. This can be accomplished by selecting tools written in
Java, which at least in theory is platform-independent.</p><p>Since the major task in processing the NC3 NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles documents are
the transformation of the XML documents to HTML and a format suitable
for printing, we need a tool that implements the XSLT 1.0
standard. Among the most popular tools are Xalan from the Apache Group
and Michael Kay's Saxon. Both of these tools are implemented in
Java, and Saxon is currently considered more mature, and
also implements most of the additional functionality
defined in the working draft XSLT 1.1, of which we need the ability to
merge multiple documents, a property not defined in the original XSLT
1.0 specification.</p><p>Before the transformation of an XML document is invoked, the
document must be parsed by an XML parser. Saxon comes preinstalled
with the AElfred parser, which is not a validating parser, required in
order to ensure that all NISP documents conform to the DocBook
specification. Most of the original XML parsers, are not validating
parsers, but recently the Apache Group have released the validating
parser Xerces.</p><p>Currently there is no open source implementation, which does a
really good job in creating a printed version of the XML
documents. The best open-source project is the FO processor
<span class="emphasis"><em>Fop</em></span>, which currently is undergoing a major
redesign effort and the frequency of releases have therefore
dramatically slowed down. There are a couple of very good commercial
implementations, which suffer seriously from the problem, that they
are very expensive.</p><p>Although there are many bugs and facilities currently
unimplemented in the FO processor. It turns out, that most of the
problems, which are relevant to the NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles documents can be temporary
solved by manipulation of the FO tree, before the layout and rendering
phase resulting in a PDF document.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch04s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch04.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch04s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">4.2. SGML &amp; XML </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 4.4. Contents of this document</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
