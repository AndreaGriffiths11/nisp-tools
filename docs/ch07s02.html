distribution can be edited using the users editor of choice. In
reality, this is not always the case, since not all editors by default
supports editing of Unicode documents yet. Most English documents
written in the Unicode standard, which is a 31 bit character set,
generally uses an encoding scheme, which allows most document to
backward compatible with ASCII. All the XML documents forming the
technical architecture documents are created using an encoding scheme
called ISO-8859-1 (also called Latin 1), which by default is support
by the XML standard. Modern versions of Word supports various Unicode
encoding schemes, although it is not obvious from the user interface,
what encoding schemes are actually supported. In one version it was
stated that word was using Unicode, but what encoding was not
specified. This is a pity, since Microsofts support for Unicode in
general is quite good. Furthermore when copying text between word
document and text documents, Word usually copy additionally
<span class="emphasis"><em>invisible characters</em></span>, which XML parsers don't
like. For this and additional reasons an open source editor jEdit
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.jedit.org/" target="_top">http://www.jedit.org/</a>) is included with the tool
distribution.  Every contributor to the NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles documents are
<span class="emphasis"><em>STRONGLY ENCOURAGED</em></span> to use this editor, which
have the additional advantages of being XML- and DocBook aware and
being able to integrate the tools package used to build the NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles
documents.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch07.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch07.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch07s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 7. Working with the NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 7.3. Processing the NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
