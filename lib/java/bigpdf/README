This Library contains the sources and build instructions for bigpdf,
which is a small Java program to merge all NISP volumes amd add
Document Summary Properties (author/title etc) to NISP PDF Documents
generated by FOP.

N.B. The document summary properties are deleted during the merge -
maybe this can be fixed with a newer version of iTexT?
