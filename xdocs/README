Markdown sources for the NISP documentation
-------------------------------------------

All files in this directory is Markdown sources to the NISP manual
pages. HTML5 versions of the pages generated with Pandoc are placed
in the docs/ directory.

Originally the documentation for NISP was written in DocBook. This
rewrite try to accomplish two things.

1) With inspiration from Unix, create small pages which focus on a
   simple topic.

2) Illustrate that markup does not necessary have to be as complex as
   docbook.

Markdown is not the best choise. A better choise would be to select
ASCIIDOC, from where it is simple to create DocBook files. However
combined with the Pandoc tools, we have the opportunity to translate
to many more formats, which might be usefull in the furture.

Markdown might also be a solution for a interactive version of NISP.
