By default the DocBook CSS stylesheets provided by version 3.0 of the XML
editor XXE (http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor) will not prefix section
numbers with components numbers (chapter/appendix). So instead of the first
section in chapter 2 is labeled 2.1, it is just labeled 1.

If the enclosed files are dropped into the configuarion directory that will
be changed. On windows it will most likely be the directory

   C:\Program Files\
