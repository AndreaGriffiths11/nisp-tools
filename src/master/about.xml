     <p>This draft document is being developed by the Interoperability
     Profiles Capability Team (IP CaT) under the authority of the NATO
     Consultation, Command and Control Board (C3B). It will be noted
     by the C3 Board (REF TBD) making the Volume 2 standards and
     volume 3 profiles mandatory for use in NATO common funded
     systems, and made available to the general public as a
     replacement for ADatP-34(G) when approved by the C3B.</p>
