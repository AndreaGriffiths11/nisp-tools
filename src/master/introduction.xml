<section><title>Background</title>

<para>The NATO C3 Board Interoperability Profiles Capability Team (IP CaT) has developed the attached version of the NATO
Interoperability Standards and Profiles (NISP) taking into account, wherever
relevant, national Technical Architecture programmes.</para>

<para>The work undertaken in this development takes into consideration
the interoperability shortfalls experienced by both NATO and the
nations. These shortfalls are notably assessed to result from an
interoperability strategy limited to standards adherence only, whilst
in large parts ignoring other design and implementation
considerations. From this viewpoint, NISP aims to improve,
complement and complete an Open Systems approach, by providing
architectural building blocks, standards and profile recommendations.</para>


<para>NISP development also tracked the evolution of the
Communication and Information Technology market where commercial
aspects have become predominant and Service Oriented Architecture approaches have risen to the forefront.</para>

<para>Against this background, the challenge that the NISP has to face
is to propose the best trade-off between the two complementary
approaches in line with NATO requirements:</para>


<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>COTS-based approach to optimise the
  cost-effectiveness of NATO C3S programmes
  development;</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Open Systems approach based on an appropriate
  selection of interface standards to adapt to technology advances
  while avoiding any product or vendor lock-in.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Service Oriented Architecture approach to directly support Interoperability 
in NATO's Network Enabled Capability initiatives.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<section><title>Context</title>

<para>NATO Policy for Interoperability of C3 systems addresses
development, from the perspective of achieving specified
interoperability requirements, on the basis of three architectural
views: Operational, System and Technical.</para>


<para>The NISP is intended to contain and describe the
capabilities and attributes of all procedures, data (standards and
products) and their relationships necessary to develop the Technical
View and part of the System View.</para>


</section>

<section><title>NISP Broad Contents</title>

<para>In practical terms, the NISP consists of a set of 4 documents.</para>

<para><ulink url="volume1/index.html">Volume 1: NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles
- Introduction and Management:</ulink> This volume deals with the NISP purpose,
    the structure and the process of collecting standards from
    stakeholders, including the configuration management and
    publication of the NISP.</para>

<para><ulink url="volume2/index.html">Volume 2: Agreed Standards:</ulink>This volume lists agreed interoperability standards. These shoul support state of-the-art of NATO and National systems today and new systems actually under procurement or specification. For new  systems, it contains near-term standards and technologies to support the NNEC Networking and Information Infrastructure (NII).</para>

<para><ulink url="volume3/index.html">Volume 3: Agreed Profiles:</ulink>This Volume provides guidance on the development of Interoperability Profiles and references or includes published agreed profiles.
</para>

<para><ulink url="volume4/index.html">Volume 4: Design Rules:</ulink>
This volume provides Design Rule Guidance and references.</para>
