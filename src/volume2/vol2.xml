    <title>Reference Models: Transition from Platform Centric to Service
    Oriented Models</title>
    <para>Information technology is undergoing a fundamental shift from
    platform-oriented computing to network-oriented computing. Platform-oriented
    computing emerged with the widespread proliferation of personal computers
    and the global business environment. These factors and related
    technologies have created the conditions for the emergence of
    network-oriented computing. This shift from platform to network is what
    enables the more flexible and more dynamic network-oriented operation. The
    shift from viewing partners as independent to viewing partners as part of
    a continuously adapting ecosystem fosters a rich information sharing
    environment.</para>
    <para>This shift is most obvious in the explosive growth of the Internet,
    intranets, and extranets. Internet users no doubt will recognize
    transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP), hypertext
    transfer protocol (HTTP), hypertext markup language (HTML), Web browsers,
    search engines, and Java<footnote><para>Registered Trademark of SUN Microsystems,
    INC.</para></footnote> Computing. These technologies, combined with
    high-volume, high-speed data access (enabled by the low-cost laser) and
    technologies for high-speed data networking (hubs and routers) have led to
    the emergence of network-oriented computing. Information &#x201C;content&#x201D; now can
    be created, distributed, and easily exploited across the extremely
    heterogeneous global computing environment. The &#x201C;power&#x201D; or &#x201C;payoff&#x201D; of
    network-enabled computing comes from information-intensive interactions
    between very large numbers of heterogeneous computational nodes in the
    network, where the network becomes the dynamic information grid
    established by interconnecting partners participating in a collaborative,
    coalition environment. At the structural level, network-enabled warfare
    requires an operational architecture to enable the common processes to be
    shared by all parties.</para>
    <para>One of the major drivers for supporting net-enabled operations is
    Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA). SOA is an architectural style<!-- enterprise architecture--> that
    leverages heterogeneity, and thus inherently platform-neutral. It is
    focused on the composition of Services into flexible processes and is more
    concerned with the Service interface and above (including composition
    metadata, security policy, and dynamic binding information), more so than
    what sits beneath the abstraction of the Service interface. SOA requires a
    different kind of platform, because runtime execution has different
    meanings within SOA. SOA enables business users and business process
    architects to compose Services into processes, and then manage and evolve
    those processes, in a declarative fashion. Runtime execution of such
    processes is therefore a metadata-centric operation of a different kind of
    platform -- a Service-oriented composite application platform.</para>
    <para>Network-enabled operations are characterized by new concepts of
    speed of command and self-synchronization.</para>
    <para>The most important SOA within an enterprise is the one that links
    all its systems. Existing platforms can be wrapped or extended in order to
    participate in a wider SOA environment. NATO use of the NISP will provide
    a template for new systems development, as well as assist in defining the
    path for existing systems to migrate towards net-enabled
    operations.</para>

	    <title>Tactical ESB - Profile</title>
	    <!-- Service Profile for a tactical Enterprise Service Bus -->
            <para condition="ignore" />
            <para>The aim of this specification is to describe a profile for a tactical
              Enterprise Service Bus (tact ESB) to be used in a coalition, highly mobile
              and distributed environment. The profile focuses specifically on requirements
              from military usage and goes beyond the ESB specification, available in 
              civil implementations/products.</para>
            <para>The profile is a generic specification; following the principle 
              construction elements, it allows for national implementations a derivation
              from the proposed one, not losing the interoperability aspects.</para>
            <para>Details of this profile are contained in: IT-AmtBw_A5_RuDi-High_Level_Concept_400.pdf (DEU)</para>

	    <!-- Service Profile for the Afghan Mission Network -->
            <para condition="ignore" />
            <para>The purpose of this specification is to define an Interoperability
              Standards Profile to support the Afghanistan Mission Network (AMN) and
              transition from today's legacy systems to NNEC by defining a basic 
              level of system interoperability in order to enhance the exchange of
              information within and across the AMN. To support the goal of widespread
              interoperability the AMN Interoperability Profile defines a minimum profile
              of services and standards for Technical Interfaces, Data Interchange 
              Standards  and Application Profile Standards that are sufficient to provide
              a useful level of interoperability.</para>
