    <para>This document is a draft under development by the NATO Open Systems Working Group (NOSWG)
 under the authority the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Board (NC3B).
  In due course it is expected to be noted by the NATO C3 Board making the Volume 2 standards and profiles mandatory for use in NATO common funded systems, and to be made available to the general public as a replacement for ADatP-34(D).</para>
    <para>Volume 2 of the NISP focuses on interoperability standards and prfoiles in the near-term or a timeframe of 0 to 2 years into the future.
    This is the short-term step describing the state-of-the-art of NATO
    systems today and the framework for new systems actually under procurement
    or specification. For new systems, it describes the initial step towards
    the NII.</para>
    <para>The Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) nations
    will use NISP Volume 2 <xref linkend="v2c-std" />,

    <xref linkend="v2s1-ts" />, <xref linkend="v2s1-ias" /> and

    for the CCEB under the provisions of the NATO-CCEB List of Understandings
    (LoU) detailed in Volume 1 Annex A. For the non-NATO CCEB nations, only a
    subset of this volume is applicable. For the CCEB, Chapters 1 and 2, Chapter
    3 Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 and Annex A of this volume are background information.
    Chapter 4 is only applicable to the non NATO CCEB Nations when taking part in

  <chapter id="v2c-refmod">
    <title>Reference Models: Transition from Platform Centric to Service
    Oriented Models</title>
    <para>Information technology is undergoing a fundamental shift from
    platform-oriented computing to network-oriented computing. Platform-oriented
    computing emerged with the widespread proliferation of personal computers
    and the global business environment. These factors and related
    technologies have created the conditions for the emergence of
    network-oriented computing. This shift from platform to network is what
    enables the more flexible and more dynamic network-oriented operation. The
    shift from viewing partners as independent to viewing partners as part of
    a continuously adapting ecosystem fosters a rich information sharing
    environment.</para>
    <para>This shift is most obvious in the explosive growth of the Internet,
    intranets, and extranets. Internet users no doubt will recognize
    transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP), hypertext
    transfer protocol (HTTP), hypertext markup language (HTML), Web browsers,
    search engines, and Java<footnote><para>Registered Trademark of SUN Microsystems,
    INC.</para></footnote> Computing. These technologies, combined with
    high-volume, high-speed data access (enabled by the low-cost laser) and
    technologies for high-speed data networking (hubs and routers) have led to
    the emergence of network-oriented computing. Information "content" now can
    be created, distributed, and easily exploited across the extremely
    heterogeneous global computing environment. The "power" or "payoff" of
    network-enabled computing comes from information-intensive interactions
    between very large numbers of heterogeneous computational nodes in the
    network, where the network becomes the dynamic information grid
    established by interconnecting partners participating in a collaborative,
    coalition environment. At the structural level, network-enabled warfare
    requires an operational architecture to enable the common processes to be
    shared by all parties.</para>
    <para>One of the major drivers for supporting net-enabled operations is
    Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA). SOA is enterprise architecture that
    leverages heterogeneity, and thus inherently platform-neutral. It is
    focused on the composition of Services into flexible processes and is more
    concerned with the Service interface and above (including composition
    metadata, security policy, and dynamic binding information), more so than
    what sits beneath the abstraction of the Service interface. SOA requires a
    different kind of platform, because runtime execution has different
    meanings within SOA. SOA enables business users and business process
    architects to compose Services into processes, and then manage and evolve
    those processes, in a declarative fashion. Runtime execution of such
    processes is therefore a metadata-centric operation of a different kind of
    platform -- a Service-oriented composite application platform.</para>
    <para>Network-enabled operations are characterized by new concepts of
    speed of command and self-synchronization.</para>
    <para>The most important SOA within an enterprise is the one that links
    all its systems. Existing platforms can be wrapped or extended in order to
    participate in a wider SOA environment. NATO use of the NISP will provide
    a template for new systems development, as well as assist in defining the
    path for existing systems to migrate towards net-enabled
    operations.</para>

        <title>Business Service Enablers</title>
        <para>The second of the main core service categories is Business
          Service Enablers (BSE). While BIS services are concerned with the
          BPIF infrastructure per se, they are not used a foundation for
          implementation of business services. This is instead the role of
          BSE, which provide basic functionality that is shared by many
          business services independently of Community of Interest
          (COI).</para>
        <para>BSE are divided into three main subcategories based on the
          types of functionality they offer.</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Collaboration BSE support basic exchange of data between
              services. Examples include message passing (uni- and multicast,
              email, etc.), distributed file sharing, publication (web pages
              etc.), and data format conversion.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Synchronization BSE support synchronization of service and
              process interaction, and includes for example time services, and
              event notification.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Common Information Services (CIS) is the third and last
              subcategory of BSE. CIS provide COI-independent support for
              access to general information like maps, glossaries, standards,
              and document registries.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Note: Not all functions in this category are necessarily
          service oriented in a SOA sense. They are nevertheless important for
          a network-oriented capability.</para>
        <para>The third area of the technical services is the communication
          services. These services provide a transparent, seamless information
          exchange capability to allow a communication between the various
          information entities above.</para>
