    <title>Core Enterprise Services Implementation Specification</title>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Development of this Profile</title>
      
      <para>The NNEC Feasibility Study (FS) of 2005 showed that NATO Network-Enabled 
      Capability (NNEC) requires the dynamic networking of coalition forces to support
      information-sharing capabilities and to support the development and provision
      of information services. The name given to this key capability is the Networking
      and Information Infrastructure (NII).</para>
      
      <para>The NNEC FS went on to name four main categories of services comprising 
      the NII: Communications services, Information and Integration services (IIS),
      Information Assurance services and Service Management and Control.</para>
      
      <para>One of the major design NNEC tenets has been to focus on an approach based
      on the principles of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  Indeed, the NNEC
      FS postulated that the concept of SOA is key to meeting the NNEC operational
      requirements and is an essential part of the overall strategy.</para>
      
      <para>The IIS services, in particular, are planned to provide the basic SOA 
      foundation that future Alliance capability would build upon.  These services 
      are collectively known as the Core Enterprise Services (CES).</para>
      
      <para>Another major vision of NNEC is that it will be “10% NATO and 90% National”,
      meaning that services will be expected to be interoperable.  The only way to
      facilitate this interoperability is to agree – throughout the NATO enterprise,
      as well as with the Nations – exactly how these services will be developed and
      referenced.  This involves not only coming up with a common architecture, but
      also agreeing the standards and interfaces that the specific services will
      implement.</para>
      
      <para>The Core Enterprise Services Framework – approved by the NC3B in spring
      2009 – describes the high-level functionality of the Core Enterprise Services: 
      the “what” of the CES.  This Reference Document offers recommendations for the
      “profile” of standards to be implemented: the “how” of the CES services that
      will provide the underlying SOA baseline for the future Alliance IT environment.
      </para>
      
      <para>These CES services will not be delivered all at the same time – nor will
      they be installed on all networks at the same time.  It is realistic to expect 
      that the CES will be delivered in two phases, or “spirals”.  The focus of this
      specification is Spiral 1: the baseline SOA functionality that is best defined 
      and for which the industry open standards are the most mature<footnote><para>Note
      that this specification is service specific and not infrastructure specific.
      When some services are not included in this CES Specification spiral 1, it 
      doesn’t mean that the functionality will not be part of the infrastructure 
      (e.g. storage as infrastructure vs. storage “as a service”). </para></footnote>.
      </para>
      
      <para>NATO and some NATO nations are already planning to implement the CES. 
      One example is the Afghan Mission Network (AMN) where the NATO CES, based on 
      this specification, will be used as part of the information infrastructure.
      </para>
      
      <para>This document seeks to outline the profiles and standards that projects
      in NATO and in the nations should aim to use, with the aim of ensuring future 
      compatibility and longevity. In this specification we focus on the use of stable
      versions of the standards and specifications, which are supported by industrial
      and open source implementations. This will give the widest range of interoperability 
      scenarios in the near to medium term, as well as the greatest level of functionality.
      </para>
      
      <para>This specification is based on the NC3A recommendation [NC3A RD-2814].
      Much of the text from that document has been re-used in this specification with
      permission from the authors.</para>

      <title>The NNEC Core Enterprise Services</title>
      
      <para>As part of the evolution towards NNEC, NATO is developing a set of NNEC
      Core Enterprise Services.  The CES are the basic SOA foundations that other 
      service-oriented applications and systems will build upon.</para>
      
      <para>As defined in the Core Enterprise Services Framework (CESF) [NC3A CESF, 2008],
      the CES are “technical services that facilitate other service and data providers
      on the enterprise network by providing and managing the underlying capabilities 
      to deliver content and value to end-users.  They can be thought of as the enablers
      used by other services and users across the whole network-enabled enterprise, 
      acting as “building blocks” for developing more sophisticated COI, cross-COI 
      and functional/application services.  They are independent of business process
      and context; and are ubiquitous."</para>
      
      <para>The CESF – which was produced by the Core Enterprise Services Working
      Group (CESWG) of the NC3B SC/5 (Information Services Sub-Committee), and agreed 
      by the Nations in 2009 via the NC3B – has identified a set of fourteen (14) 
      services (12 Core Enterprise Services + Service Security (Information Assurance)
      and Enterprise Service Management) which together make up the CES.  This service
      catalogue has also been carefully coordinated with the emerging NATO Overarching
      Architecture and the Information and Integration Services (IIS) Reference Architecture.

      <title>A Spiral Approach and Maturity Levels</title>
      
      <para>These services will not be delivered all at the same time – nor will they 
      be installed on all networks at the same time.  It is realistic to expect that
      the CES will be delivered in several phases, or “spirals”. The Core Enterprise 
      Services are described in the CES Framework Document [NC3A CESF, 2009].</para>

        <para>The following figure is taken from the CES Framework Document [NC3A CESF, 2009]
        and shows the overall CES logical implementation progression diagram. This 
        represents a logical progression of delivering CES to enable NNEC maturity 
        levels and, at the same time, achieve higher SOA maturity levels.</para>

      <para>It is clear that achieving NNEC Maturity - and also SOA Maturity at the 
      information systems level – is partly enabled by the delivery of Core Enterprise
      Services. It is the suggestion of this Framework that NATO’s Capability Packages
      (CP) be quickly evaluated to ensure timely delivery of the first of these 
      enabling services to begin moving along the path towards maturity.</para>
        
      <para>We can see that the services incorporated to Spiral 1 relates to the 
      SOA Maturity Level 2 as described in the CES Framework.</para>

      <para>Spiral 1 reflects what the CES Framework states as the first – or “foundation” 
      – SOA implementation will look like for NNEC.  These services are relatively 
      well-defined, with relatively mature associated standards, and thus it is believed 
      that the services are ready to be developed/procured in the short term.</para>
      
      <para>Spiral 2 is a mid-term goal, representing enhancements to the initial
      baseline, along with the implementation of “extended” or “enhanced” SOA Services.
      This is because the standards are still evolving, or the functionality has yet
      to be adequately prototyped, and it is unlikely that these Core Enterprise 
      Services will exist in the near-term.  These services include the following:

      <para>This document is focused on the Spiral 1, or the initial SOA Baseline 
      (“SOA Foundation”), and will specify in detail how the eight Core Enterprise
      Services are to be implemented. The remaining six extended SOA Services (Spiral 
      2) are mentioned in this section but are not discussed in detail.</para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>How to use this Document</title>
      
      <para>This CES Implementation specification is based upon the Web Services
      Interoperability Organization (WS-I), an industry consortium that promotes
      interoperability amongst the stack of Web services specifications (Web services
      are a common implementation of SOA.).  WS-I does not propose its own standards,
      but instead tries to “profile” existing ones.  The organization has developed
      what it calls the “Basic Profile”, which suggests a specific collection of 
      standards for basic interoperability.  In this Reference Document, the Basic
      Profile 1.1 Second Edition has been recommended as the starting point for NATO’s
      future SOA implementations.</para>
      
      <para>From there, this specification goes on to recommend a complete set of 
      standards to fulfil all of the Spiral 1 Core Enterprise Service requirements 
      by providing a baseline SOA infrastructure, covering messaging, discovery, 
      security, and so on.    It is intended that applications that will use the 
      SOA baseline – such as Functional Services and Community of Interest services
      – will always follow the mandated standards; the others will be implemented 
      by the CES themselves for compatibility with legacy services and/or national
      implementations.</para>
      
      <para>Following the profile of standards specified in this document does not
      by itself guarantee interoperability.  However, agreeing on and implementing 
      the SOA baseline as specified in this document will be a major step on the 
      road to a coherent network enabled capability spanning NATO communities and
      Nations.</para>

      its SOA infrastructure:

    <title>The SOA Baseline - NNEC Core Enterprise Services</title>
    <sect2>
      <title>Introduction</title>
      
      <para>As introduced in Section 1, the Core Enterprise Services Framework ([NC3A
      CESF, 2009]) described a set of Core Enterprise Services (CES) – sometimes 
      referred to as the “what” of the NNEC CES.  This section addresses the “how”
      by detailing the profile of functionality and mandated standards for each of
      the Spiral 1 CES.</para>
      
      <para>For each Core Enterprise Service that is expected to be part of the Spiral 
      1 SOA Baseline, the following sections identify:</para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Overview of the service</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Functionality that the service provides</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Mandated Standards</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Spiral 1 Implementation</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>Sources of Recommendation</title>
      
      <para>When constructing a profile of standards to use within a large organisation, 
      there are a wide range of sources that provide input into the choices that need
      to be made.</para>
      
      <para>The specific standards that are presented in the following sections have
      been compiled from various sources, including standards bodies, NATO agreed
      documents and practical experience of conducting experiments with nations and
      within projects.</para>
      
      <para>Because of the time that it takes to ratify a standard or profile, the
      standards that are recommended in the SOA Baseline may not be the most recent
      or up to date versions. Some of the most important sources for defining the 
      mandated set of standards for use in NATO are described in the following
      sections.</para>
   
      <sect3>
        <title>The WS-I Profiles</title>
      
        <para>The Web Services Interoperability Organization has developed a collection
        of “profiles” that greatly simplify the interoperability of SOA Web services.
        Profiles provide implementation guidelines for how related Web services specifications 
        should be used together for best interoperability between heterogeneous systems.
        </para>
      
        <para>The general profile for service interoperability is called the Basic 
        Profile, which describes how the core Web services specifications – such as
        Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web Service Description Language (WSDL)
        and Universal Description Discovery Integration (UDDI) – should be used together
        to develop interoperable Web services.  Specifically, the profile identifies
        a set of non-proprietary Web services standards and specifications and provides
        clarifications, refinements, interpretations and amplifications of them that
        promote interoperability.</para>
       
        <para>In addition, the WS-I has a number of other profiles that are adopted
        in this specification.</para>
      
        <para>This specification mandates the WS-I basic profile 1.1 (Second Edition),
        the WS-I Basic Security Profile (version 1.1), the WS-I Simple SOAP Binding 
        Profile (version 1.0) and the Attachments Profile (version 1.0). In this
        specification there are exceptions to the use of some of the specifications
        included in the WS-I profiles. These exceptions as noted in the following table.
        </para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>NNEC SOA Baseline Profile Quick Reference</title>
      
      <para>The following sections detail the mandated functionality and standards
      for each of the “Spiral 1” Core Enterprise Services that make up the SOA baseline.
      This “profile” of SOA specifications is summarised in the following table. In 
      the cases where a version of a standard in the table deviates from the version
      of the standard in the WS-I profiles, the version of the standard explicitly
      defined in the table replaces the related version of the standard in the profile.
      </para>
      
      <para>The last column of the table indicates in which WS-I profile(s) the 
      standard or profile is referenced (if any).  Therefore if a profile is quoted,
      it is mandatory to use it when implementing that service. The WS-I Profiles 
      used are:</para>

        <listitem><para>WS-I Basic Profile 1.1</para></listitem>
