      <para>To paraphrase William Shakespeare <footnote><para>"O! be some other name: What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet"</para></footnote> "What's in a name? That which we call a profile by any other name would mean the same".  The problem is that the meaning of profile does not always mean the same thing; it is dependent upon the context in which it is used.</para>
