        <title>NATO C3 Technical Architecture</title>
        <para>In December 2005 the NATO Open System Working Group completed
        version 7 of the NATO C3 Technical Architecture (NC3TA). In May 2006
        the Information Systems Sub Committee (ISSC) approved version 7 of the
        NC3TA on behalf of the NATO C3 Board (NC3B). Due to the reasons
        described below, this was the last version of the NC3TA. In December
        2006 the NOSWG completed the first version of the NATO
        Interoperability Standards and Profiles (NISP) which is the
        replacement for the NC3TA. The first version of the NISP was noted by
        the C3 Capabilities Coherence Sub-Committee. At its meeting on 28
        September 2007, The NC3REPS agreed that they would, on behalf of the
        NC3B, approve future versions of the NISP.</para>
      </sect2>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="v1s2-need-for-change">
      <title>Transformation to a Services Oriented Approach</title>
      <para>The structure of the NC3TA was
      based on a platform centric environment. This structure withstood the
      test of time, as indicated in the seven published versions of the NC3TA.
      At the Prague Summit in November 2002, Heads of State agreed to the
      Prague Capability Commitment (PCC) which put into place a series of
      measures to increase the deployability and usability of NATO forces. Two
      major measures to reach these goals are The NATO Response Force (NRF)
      and net-enabled capabilities. NATO, Nations and industry are all
      adopting Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach, and its loose coupling,
 system development as a means to achieve net-enabled
      capabilities. It is recognised that the required changes cannot be
      implemented overnight. A controlled transformation through a series of
      maturity stages need to be achieved, responding to evolutionary sets of
      operational objectives. This gradual transformation to a network enabled
      environment based on SOA leading to better support for the NRF resulted
      in the need to restructure the NC3TA.</para>
      <para>During the transformation to a
      network enabled environment there will be a need to support both
      platform centric and network enabled environments for a number of years.
      Since both of these environments are based upon providing services, this
      leads to confusion when trying to differentiate what is a service in
      each of the environment. The distinction between services in a platform
      or system centric environment and a service oriented environment is
      described in NISP Annex A.</para>

    <title>Purpose of the NISP</title>
    <para>The NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles (NISP) provides the
    necessary guidance and technical components to support project
    implementations and transition to NATO Network Enabled Capability (NNEC).
    Also the Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) nations use the
    NISP to publish the interoperability standards for the CCEB under the
    provisions of the NATO-CCEB List of Understandings (LoU) detailed in <xref linkend="v1b-LOU" /> of this volume. In addition, in order to support
    the Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC), more emphasis is placed on interoperability profiles to support
    the NRF and transition from today's legacy systems to NNEC.</para>
    <para>The purpose of the NISP is to:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Encourage Nations to use the same standards as within the NATO CIS implementations in NATO led operations;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Identify applicable Profiles as a baseline for optimising
            service and standards implementation and utilization to support
            cross-domain scenarios.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The stakeholders of the NISP are all NNEC stakeholders involved in development, implementation, lifecycle management, and transformation to an NNEC environment.</para>
    <para>This document provide a general description of the current version of the
    NISP. Volume 1 of the six volumes deals with the NISP background,
    the structure and the process of collecting standards from
    stakeholders, including the configuration management and
    publication of the NISP. Volume 2 focuses on near-term
    implementation (i.e.  present<footnote><para>Date of Approval by
    the NC3REPS on behalf of the NC3B</para></footnote> to 2 years in
    the future), Volume 3 focuses on mid-term implementation (2 to 6
    years in the future), and Volume 4 focuses on long term
    implementations (greater than 6 years in the future). Volume 5 contains a supporting
    Rationale that describes the rationale for the content of
    volumes 2, 3 and 4.; Volume 6 contains a number of
    appendices relevant to the NISP.</para>
    <para>The mandatory standards and profiles in Volume 2 will be used in the
    implementation of NATO Common Funded Systems. Participating nations agree to use the mandatory standards and profiles included in the NISP at the Service Interoperability Points and to use Service Interface Profiles among NATO and Nations to support the exchange of information and the use of information services in the NATO realm.</para>
    <para>A NISP Profile contains more than a technical standards profile with
    a protocol stack and implementation options and settings. It also includes
    a refined operational view depicting the placement of the profile and its
    relationships with other profiles; and a refined system view identifying
    the service components and their descriptions.</para>
    <!-- A NISP Design Rule will be used to document and package proven
    solutions that are expected to speed up development, and reduce cost and
    risk, by reusing knowledge on how to solve recurring problems and by
    providing verified solutions to those problems. Moreover, the use of
    Design Rules should provide a means to coordinate development of different
    federated systems in order to make them network enabled and facilitate the
    evolvement of combined capabilities. -->

       C H A P T E R 3 - NISP STRUCTURE
 *****************************************************************

  <chapter id="v1c-Structure">
    <title>NISP Structure</title>
    <para>The structure of the NISP is determined by several factors:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Ease of use for the users of the NISP;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Implementation strategy of the NNEC vision;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Nature of standards, profiles and design rules.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Partitioning the NISP into timeframes of near, mid and far-term was
    greatly influenced by the NNEC FS, national NEC development and industry
    best practices. One common thread through all these efforts is the need to
    partition NATO CIS implementations and transition to NNEC into well
    defined time periods which are:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Near-term: 0 to 2 years;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Mid-term: 2 to 6 years;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Far-term: more than 6 years out.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The NISP reflects these timeframes in individual volumes. To provide
    consistency between these volumes and ease of tracking technology trends
    and influences, each of these three volumes has similar structures
    containing major sections dealing with:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Technology</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Standards</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Profiles</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Transition</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>These similar structures enable one to focus in on an area of
    interest (i.e. NRF profile) and to track this area of interest from
    today's legacy systems transforming towards the NNEC paradigm.</para>
    <para>Standards and profiles are the centrepiece of each volume. The
    standards part of each volume provides an overview of those standards that
    must be taken into account when developing architectures that cover
    systems having their life-cycle within the period of time applicable for
    this volume.</para>
    <para>The profiles are derived based on operational requirements which
    influence required services and interoperability points.</para>
    <para>The NISP contains the four following main volumes:</para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Volume 1 - Overview and Management</emphasis>:
    This volume provides the management framework for the development and
    configuration control of the NISP and includes the general management
    procedures for the application of the NISP in NATO C3 systems development
    and the process for handling Request for Change Proposals (RFCP).</para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Volume 2 - Near-term</emphasis>: This volume
    provides the interoperability standards and profiles in the near-term
    period with the emphasis on platform centric environment. This is the
    short-term step describing the state of-the-art of NATO and National
    systems today and the framework for new systems actually under procurement
    or specification. For new systems, it contains near-term standards,
    profiles, and technologies to support the initial steps towards Networking
    and Information Infrastructure (NII).</para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Volume 3 - Mid-term</emphasis>: This volume
    will describe the evolution from the platform based NCOE to the loosely
    coupled Network Enabled Capabilities environment where the functionality
    of the interconnected systems is made generally available as "services on
    the net". Ultimately the goal is that all systems shall be connected. By
    means of real time configuration of interacting systems, it is possible to
    combine the functionality of the most useful systems in each
    situation.</para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Volume 4 - Far-term</emphasis>: This volume of
    the document focus is on the long-term perspective. The long-term
    perspective has a time frame of 7 to 10 years into the future from the
    publication of this version of the NISP. This is the concluding step to
    the realization of a fully network enabled NATO coalition
    environment.</para>
    <para>In addition to these four volumes, the NISP is supported by a
    Rationale volume that describes the rationale for the selection of the
    standards and profiles contained in Volumes 2 through 4; and an Annex
    volume containing the following appendicies:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Services and Interoperability Points in Platform Oriented and
        SOA Environments;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>NATO, National and Industry NEC Implementation Approaches;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Reference Models used in volumes 2 through 4 to structure and
        organise the standards and technologies;</para>
      </listitem>
<listitem><para>Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) Profile in the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) context;</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Guidelines using design rules in NATO NEC federated  environment;</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>International Military Interoperability for information exchange in the NNEC context.</para>
</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Technology standards will transition through a life-cycle. This
    life-cycle is used to refine the categorisation of standards within the
    volumes 2 through 4 and is also a key to providing guidance on the use of
    standards in the development and transition of NATO CIS. The NISP has
    adopted the five categories of in the life-cycle of standards shown below
    in <xref linkend="v1f1-stdscat" />.</para>
    <figure id="v1f1-stdscat" float="0">
      <title>Standards Categories</title>

          <imagedata fileref="figures/v1-stdscat1.svg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>
    <para>Proposed standards can be accepted as emerging standards in order to
    follow their developments and decide if they can be promoted to mandatory
    standards. In some cases proposed standards can be readily accepted as
    mandatory standards. Emerging standards have been partitioned into
    specific categories of emerging near-term, emerging mid-term and emerging
    far-term to better support the transition to NNEC. Similarly, containment
    standards have been classified as either fading or retired.</para>
    <para>A short description of each category is described below:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Mandatory</emphasis>: A standard is
        considered <emphasis role="bold">mandatory</emphasis> if it is mature
        enough to be used immediately. This means that it may both be applied
        within existing systems and in within mid-term future planned
        systems.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Emerging near-term</emphasis>: A standard
        is considered <emphasis role="bold">emerging near-term</emphasis> if
        it is mature enough to be used within the 0 - 2 year time frame of
        Volume 2.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Emerging mid-term</emphasis>: A standard
        is considered <emphasis role="bold">emerging mid-term</emphasis> if it
        is sufficiently mature to be used within the current or next planned
        systems. This means that it may be applied within future mid-term
        planned systems.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Emerging far-term</emphasis>: A standard
        is considered <emphasis role="bold">emerging far-term</emphasis> if it
        deals with technology that is expected to be useful in the long term
        to NATO. Use of this standard in systems is not allowed, for example
        because there is insufficient lack of support from commercial
        companies or because the underlying technology is considered not
        mature enough.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Fading</emphasis>: A standard is
        considered <emphasis role="bold">fading</emphasis> if the standard is
        still applicable for existing systems. The standard however is
        becoming obsolete or will be replaced by a newer version or another
        standard. Except for legacy systems or interoperability with legacy
        systems, the standard may not be used.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Retired</emphasis>: A standard is
        considered <emphasis role="bold">retired</emphasis> if the standard,
        that has been used in the past, is not applicable for existing
        systems.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Rejected</emphasis>: A standard is
        considered <emphasis role="bold">rejected</emphasis> if, while it was
        still emerging, it is considered unsuitable for use within
        NATO.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Each standard in the NISP has a set of categories allocated to it
    that are applicable to the timeframe covered:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Volume 2 - Near-term: Category can be "Mandatory", "Emerging

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <sect1 id="v1s1-nsd">
      <title>NISP Structure Drivers</title>
      <para>In general, systems development approaches suggest a clean line of
      reasoning from requirements capturing to architecture, to design and
      build via testing to implementation and utilisation and finally to
      retirement. In practice there is not always an opportunity (time or
      money) for such a "clean" approach and compromises must be made: from
      requirements immediately to build and implementation. In recognition of
      this fact NATO has developed a parallel track approach, which allows some
      degree of freedom in the systems development approach. Although
      variations in sequence and speed of the different steps in the approach
      are possible, some elements need to be present in one form or another.
      Architecture, including the selection of appropriate standards and
      technologies, is such a mandatory step.</para>
      <para>In a top-down execution of the systems development approach,
      architecture will provide guidance and overview to the required
      functionality and the solution patterns, based on long-standing and
      visionary operational requirements. In a bottom-up execution of the
      approach, usually responding to urgent requirements and operational
      imperatives, architecture will be used to assess and validate chosen
      solution in order to align with the longer term vision.</para>
      <para>The NISP is a major tool for the architecture work and must be
      suitable for use in the different variations of the systems development
      approach.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="v1s2-nrf">
      <title>NATO Response Force (NRF)</title>
      <para>The NISP is intended to expedite the process of establishing an
      NRF component command and interconnecting NATO and coalition partners
      serving in support of that command. As one of the strategic initiatives
      within NATO, the NRF introduces several challenges. Due to the NRF
      command rotations, and the majority of CIS capability to be provided by
      Nations (90%), the NISP will focus its products on the Interoperability
      Point (IOP) between these entities. By defining interface profiles at
      the IOP between NATO and Nations, an agreed upon technical solution can
      be identified, agreed to, tested, and implemented in a joint forum,
      prior to deployment. In this way, a relevant product is always available
      for use by the NRF community, and a vehicle for ongoing improvement is
      in place to accommodate requests for change proposals and lessons
      learned for future rotations. The NRF Interface Profiles based upon the
      NISP profile guidance document serves as a tool for assessing
      interoperability, conducting certification and approval by NRF CIS
      Planners, and accelerating capability fielding by NRF commands.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="v1s1-Implementation">
      <title>Management and Implementation Approaches</title>
      <para>The Management Approach to NNEC has identified four coherance
      areas as a management mechanism to organise information about NNEC
      developments in order to facilitate NNEC governance. The four NNEC
      Coherance Areas are:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Operational Concepts and Requirements Implications
          (OCRI);</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Leadership and Guidance (L &amp; G).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The purpose of the OCRI Coherence Area is to improve coherence
      across the operational community of all activities which need to address
      NNEC. The goals of OCRI are to ensure that NNEC principles are addressed
      in all concept development, identify and derive common NNEC service
      requirements from operational concepts and requirements, to provide NNEC
      concepts and technological advances for use by developers of operational
      concepts, doctrine and organisation, to define operational
      interoperability metrics, and to recommend operational
      improvements.</para>
      <para>The purpose of the ASDS Coherence Area is to improve the coherence
      of interoperability standards. The goals of ASDS are to oversee the
      development of a common service-oriented architectural framework and set
      of service definitions based on operational needs, to update these as
      new technologies and operational needs are developed, and to define
      service-based maturity levels.</para>
      <para>The purpose of the Implementation Coherence area is to improve
      NNEC coherence across all capability delivery programs. The goals of
      Implementation are to identify current and future service availability,
      to identify services shortfalls, to perform interoperability evaluation
      and assessment, and make recommendations for changes.</para>
      <para>The purpose of the L &amp; G Coherence Area is to support NNEC
      governance and to ensure overall coherence. The goals of L &amp; G are
      to establish levels of ambition, to establish high level NNEC policies,
      to provide coordination between all four Coherence Areas, and to provide
      widespread awareness of information about NNEC.</para>
      <para>The NOSWG supports the C3CCSC as a coordination body for the ASDS
      by Identifying Standards appropriate for all architectures and profiles
      supporting implementation solutions.</para>
      <para>The Implementation Coherence area also needs to adhere to the
      standards, grouped in profiles that are placed in the NISP as
      'agreements'.</para>
      <para>However the role of coordination bodies for the four Coherence
      Areas will require significant additional staff work. Although it is
      expected that the NATO C3 Representatives (NC3Reps) will become the
      coordination body for Leadership and Guidance (L &amp; G), the
      coordination bodies have not been agreed for the other Coherence Areas.
      Once identified and agreed, each designated coordination body will need
      to determine whether the work can be achieved by reallocating personnel
      from existing tasks or whether there is a need to hire additional
      staff.</para>
      <para>NATO, Nations and industry have all recognized the necessity to
      migrate to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based implementation to
      support NNEC. The set of standards and profiles formerly identified in the platform based approach were not adequate to support either the SOA or the NNEC concept. It was therefore a necessity to reorganise and rework the NISP to identify additional standards and profiles to support service specifications. During this rework it came apparent that the NISP needs to support not only a time phased implementation, but also the ongoing work on developing a maturity model to help NATO and Nations to develop roadmaps for NII achievement.</para>
      <para>Partitioning the NISP into timeframes of near, mid and far-term
      was greatly influenced by the NNEC Feasibility Study, NATO Architecture approach,
      national NEC development and industry best practices. One common thread
      through all these efforts is the need to partition NATO CIS
      implementations into well defined time periods in order to transition to
      NII.</para>
      <para>NATO, Nations and industry have adopted a time phased approach
      achieving their respective goals for system implementations. Although
      using different terminologies and time frames, these approaches are
      based on the same concept of mapping of standards and profiles to
      timeframes. The NISP has adopted this approach as a guiding concept for
      its development.</para>
      <para>In addition there is another strong need to develop Roadmaps for
      NNEC implementation. These roadmaps will describe which level of
      maturity that either NATO or the Nation shall achieve at a specific
      point in time. The identified maturity level will point or map to
      specific standards and profiles that are required in order to be
      interoperable and compliant.</para>
      <para>The following sub-sections contain some representative examples of
      the maturity level model and of the time phased approach for specifying
      standards and technologies.</para>
      <sect2 id="v1s2-NII-NML">
        <title>NII Maturity Level (NML) Model <footnote><para>Referred to as the NII Capability Maturity Model in the NNEC
            Feasibility Study, Annex G to Volume II, October 2005</para></footnote></title>
        <para>The concept of a NII Maturity Level was one of the two main
        components of the NII Interoperability Framework (NIIF), the other
        component being the Information Interoperability (I-Squared) Index. In
        general terms, the NML supports Programme planning and auditing
        activities across NATO and the nations, while the I-Squared Index will
        be a more detailed technical reference document.</para>
        <para>One of the challenges in implementing an effective NEC involving
        NATO, NATO nations, coalition partners, government agencies, and
        non-government organisations is to ensure a common understanding of
        information infrastructure capabilities including interoperability,
        based on objective criteria. This challenge is particularly difficult
        in an alliance context where there is no overall authority so
        policies, procedures, and standards cannot be directed from a central
        authority. NATO does not have any guaranteed insight into nor any
        responsibilities towards national infrastructure programs. In response
        to this challenge a time-phased NML approach is proposed as a solution
        to ensuring this common understanding.</para>
        <para>The NML approach uses a five-level definition of capabilities
        numbered from 1 to 5, defining increasing levels of capabilities. This
        five level approach provides an intuitive and easily understood
        measurement of a complex capability and is extremely useful for
        effective communications between diverse audiences. It must be noted,
        however, that the NML approach is designed to improve processes and
        not to measure actual physical infrastructure. However the use of a
        five level model with defined information infrastructure capabilities
        for each level with specific objective criteria is a simple and
        powerful approach.</para>
        <para>It should also be noted that this NML approach to NNEC
        capability could be expanded to cover not only the NII but the
        complete spectrum of capabilities, perhaps divided into the Doctrine,
        organisation, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel
        and Facilities (DOTMLPF) categories currently used in assessing a
        force capability. This would provide a more complete model to assess
        the capabilities of a force but was beyond the scope of the NNEC
        Feasibility study.</para>
        <para>A five level model can be related to the overall vision of NNEC
        which defines four levels of mission capability, namely Deconflict,
        Coordinate, Collaborate, and Coherent. A fifth level of capability,
        reflecting a rudimentary capability, called "Stand-Alone" could be
        added, below Deconflict. This would reflect an organisation or
        military unit with little or no capabilities, procedures, nor
        experience in interoperating with other military forces or
        organisations. It is anticipated, (indeed hoped) that there will be
        few forces or organisations that fit into this rudimentary capability
        category.</para>
        <para>The NML presented in the NNEC Feasibility Study Volume II Annex
        G consisted of two major components. The first was the
        time-independent NML itself which was derived directly from the
        overall time-independent NNEC NML developed in Volume 1 of the study
        and is in turn tied into the required NNEC operational capabilities
        expressed as Mission Capability Packages (MCPs). The second component
        was the time-dependent Infrastructure Implementation (I-Squared) Index
        which was derived from the first NML component, but provides
        measurable criteria for use in defining and implementing an NII
        roadmap. Note that full completion of the I-Squared Index including
        validation of the criteria values would take considerable effort and
        was not within the scope of the NNEC Feasibility study.</para>

      <title>NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles Application to
      Architectures</title>
      <para>The NATO Interoperability Directive (NID) defines what types of
      architectures are to be developed within NATO: namely Baseline
      Architectecture (BA), Target Architecture (TA), Reference Architecture
      (RA), and Overarching Architecture (OA). These architecture types can be
      related to the NISP Volumes 2, 3 and 4 as follows:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Volume 2 contains the standards mostly applicable to the TA's

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>In particular the relationship with the Overarching Architecture
      is of a reciprocal nature. The OA also provides inputs to the NISP by
      identifying the technology areas that in the future will require
      standards. The OA also provides guidance on the coherence of standards
      by indicating in which timeframe certain standards and profiles are
      required.</para>
      <para>The work on RA's and TA's will benefit from the NISP by selecting
      coherent sets of standards for solution patterns.</para>
