    <title>Introduction</title>

<para>The NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles (NISP) is developed by the NATO Consultation, Command and Control (C3) Board Interoperability Profiles Capability Team (IP CaT) and the NISP will be made available to the general public as ADatP-34(I) when approved by the C3 Board
<footnote><para>AC/322-N(2013)0197-REV3-AS1 approved ADatP-34(H)</para></footnote>.  The included interoperability standards (Volume 2) and profiles (Volume 3) are mandatory for use in NATO common funded Communications and Information Systems (CIS).
<!--  The NISP will be made available to the general public as ADatP-34(J) when approved by the C3 Board.

  <chapter id="v1c-Purpose">
    <title>Purpose</title>

    <para>The NISP prescribes the necessary technical standards and profiles to achieve interoperability of Communications and Information Systems in support of NATO's missions and operations. In accordance with the Alliance C3 Strategy (ref. C-M(2014)0016) all NATO enterprise<footnote><para>The NATO Enterprise has been identified in C-M(2014)0061</para></footnote> entities shall adhere to the NISP prescribed standards and profiles. Allies and Partners in order to achieve Nation to NATO and Nation to Nation technical interoperability are advised to adhere to these standards and profiles.  These standards and profiles are mandatory for those Allies and Partners joining a federated network implemented for a NATO-led mission.</para>
    
  </chapter>

  <chapter id="v1c-Audience">
    <title>Intended Audience</title>

    <para>The intended audience of the NISP are all stakeholders in the NATO Enterprise, in Allied and Partner nations involved in development, implementation, lifecycle management, and transformation to a federated environment.</para>

    <title>NISP Structure Drivers</title>
    <para>In general, systems development approaches suggest a clean line of reasoning from requirements capturing to architecture, to design and build via testing to implementation and utilization and finally to retirement.</para>
    <para>The structure of the NISP is determined by several factors:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Ease of use for the users of the NISP;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Nature of standards and profiles.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The NISP contains three volumes:</para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Volume 1 - Introduction and Management</emphasis>: This volume provides the management framework for the development and configuration control of the NISP and includes the general management procedures for the application of the NISP in NATO C3 systems development and the process for handling Request for Change Proposals (RFCP).</para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Volume 2 - Agreed Standards</emphasis>: This volume lists agreed interoperability standards. These should support NATO and National systems today and new systems actually under procurement or specification.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Volume 3 - Profiles</emphasis>: This Volume provides Interoperability Profiles and guidance on their development.  Interoperability Profiles provide collections of standards and (sub)profiles for different military CIS.  Interoperability Profiles identify essential profile elements including:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Capability Requirements and other NAF architectural views,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>characteristic protocols,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>implementation options,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>technical standards,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Service Interoperability Points, and</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the relationship with other profiles such as the system profile to which an application belongs.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>These profiles will be referenced in the NISP for specified NATO Common Funded Systems or Capability Packages and may include descriptions of interfaces to National Systems where appropriate.</para>
<para>Technology standards are subjected to a life-cycle. This
    life-cycle is used to refine the categorization of standards within volumes 2 and 3 and is a key to providing guidance on the use of
    standards in the development and transition of NATO CIS. The NISP has adopted the five categories of standards in the life-cycle shown below
    in <xref linkend="v1f1-stdscat" />.</para>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>
    <para>Proposed standards can be accepted as emerging standards in order to
    follow their developments and decide if they can be promoted to mandatory
    standards. In some cases proposed standards can be readily accepted as
    mandatory standards. Containment standards have been classified as either fading or retired.</para>
    <para>A short description of each category is described below:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Mandatory</emphasis>: A standard is considered <emphasis role="bold">mandatory</emphasis> if it is mature enough to be used immediately. This means that it may both be applied within existing systems and in future(mid-term) planned systems. NATO STANAG's that are promulgated shall be considered mandatory.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Emerging</emphasis>: A standard is considered <emphasis role="bold">emerging</emphasis> if it is sufficiently mature to be used within the current or next planned systems. Some emerging standards may not be immediately suitable. For example, commercial companies may not support the standards or the underlying technology is not considered mature. NATO STANAG's that are not promulgated, superseded or cancelled shall be considered emerging.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Fading</emphasis>: A standard is considered <emphasis role="bold">fading</emphasis> if the standard is still applicable for existing systems; however, it is becoming obsolete, or will be replaced by a newer version, or another standard is being proposed. Except for legacy systems or interoperability with legacy systems, the standard may not be used.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Retired</emphasis>: A standard is considered <emphasis role="bold">retired</emphasis> if the standard has been used in the past and is not applicable to existing CIS systems. NATO STANAG's that are superseded or cancelled shall be considered retired.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Rejected</emphasis>: A standard is considered <emphasis role="bold">rejected</emphasis> if, while it was still emerging, it is considered unsuitable for use within NATO.</para>

  <chapter id="v1c-NISPArchitecture">
    <title>NISP and Architecture</title>
    <sect1 id="v1s-NDPP">
    <title>Architecture and Interoperability in the context of NATO Defence Planning</title>
    <para>The NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) is the primary means to identify the required capabilities and promote their timely and coherent development and acquisition by Allies. It is operationally driven and delivers various products which could support the development and evolution of more detailed C3 architecture and interoperability requirements.  The development of NDPP products also benefits from input by the architecture and interoperability communities, especially the NISP, leading to a more coherent development of CIS capabilities for the Alliance.</para>
    <para>Ideally technical interoperability requirements align with the NDPP to ensure coherence in the development of capabilities within the Alliance.  NDPP Mission Types and Planning Situations provide the essential foundation for the development of the Minimum Capability Requirements (MCR) and the derivation of high level information exchange and interoperability requirements.  MCRs are expressed via a common set of definitions for capabilities (including CIS) called Capability Codes and Statements (CC&amp;S), including explicit reference to STANAGs in some cases [Bi-SC Agreed Capability Codes and Capability Statements, 14 October 2012
 SHAPE/CPPCAMFCR/JM/281143 5000 TSC FRX 0030/TT-7673/Ser:NU0053 ].  Interoperability aspects are primarily captured in free text form within the Capability Statements and in the subsequent NDPP Targets [C-M(2013)0023, Capability Target Reports, 29 May 2013].  The NDPP products could be leveraged by the architecture and interoperability community, to define the operational context for required architecture building blocks and interoperability profiles.</para>
    <para>The Defence Planning Capability Survey (DPCS) is the tool to collect information on national capabilities, the architecture and interoperability communities should provide input on questions related to C3 related capabilities.  The architecture and interoperability communities could also bring valuable insight and expertise to the formulation and tailoring of C3 capabilities-related targets to nations, groups of nations or the NATO enterprise.</para>
    <para>In practice, there is not always an opportunity (time or money) for such a "clean" approach and compromises must be made - from requirements identification to implementation. In recognition of this fact, NATO has developed a parallel track approach, which allows some degree of freedom in the systems development approach. Although variations in sequence and speed of the different steps in the approach are possible, some elements need to be present. Architecture, including the selection of appropriate standards and technologies, is a mandatory step.</para>
    <para>In a top-down execution of the systems development approach, architecture will provide guidance and overview to the required functionality and the solution patterns, based on longstanding and visionary operational requirements. In a bottom-up execution of the approach, which may be required when addressing urgent requirements and operational imperatives, architecture will be used to assess and validate chosen solution in order to align with the longer term vision.</para>
    <para>The NISP is a major tool supported by architecture work and must be suitable for use in the different variations of the systems development approach. The NISP will be aligned with the Architectural efforts of the C3 Board led by the Architecture Capability Team (Architecture CaT).</para>

    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="v1s-NISPArch">
    <title>NISP Application to Reference Architectures</title>
    <para>The relationship of the NISP and the Reference Architecture effort of Allied Command Transformation is of a mutual and reciprocal nature. The architecture products provide inputs to the NISP by identifying the technology areas that in the future will require standards. The architecture products also provide guidance on the coherence of standards by indicating in which timeframe certain standards and profiles are required.</para>
    <para>The work on Reference Architectures (RA) and Technical Architecture (TA) will benefit from the NISP by selecting coherent sets of standards for profiles.</para>
    </sect1>

  </chapter>

  <chapter id="v1c-ConfigurationManagement">
    <title>Configuration Management</title>
   <para>The NISP is updated<!--<footnote><para>A more detailed description of the NISP Configuration Management process is available in the IP CaT "Standard Operating Procedures (SoP)"</para></footnote>--> at least once a year to account for the evolution of standards and profiles. Updates to the NISP are handled through a "Requests for Change Proposal" (RFCP) process. RFCPs are identified by stakeholders (users, C3 Board and its sub structure, SMEs, the IP CaT, and nations) and are formally submitted to the IP CaT.  The IP CaT reviews the submissionsin dialog with national and international bodies. Based on that review, the RFCP will be formally added to the next version of the NISP or returned to the originator for further details or rejected.  The NISP database will be immediately updated.</para>

<para>RFCPs deemed urgent are handled in an expedited manner, outside the normal meeting schedule of the IP CaT.</para>

<para>As technology is made available, the NISP development and submission of RFCPs will be automated.  The ultimate goal of incorporating advanced technology will be to shorten the time required for coordination of NISP updates and reduce the effort required to produce the NISP.</para>

<para>The NISP with updates is submitted to the C3 Board by year end after internal review by the IP CaT.  The version under review is a snapshot in time of the status of standards and profiles.</para>

<para>The database of standards and profiles maintained by the IP CaT is the definitive source of the currents status of standards and profiles. The database will be updated as soon as the RFCP has been approved by the C3 Board.</para>

    <sect1 id="v1s1-NISP-Update">
      <title>NISP Update Process</title>
      <para>Updating the NISP and its associated database will be conducted by the IP CaT in a managed, rolling review process which will take into account information on standards available from a wide variety of sources.</para>

    <sect1 id="v1s1-RFCP">
