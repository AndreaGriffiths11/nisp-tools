<title>Introduction</title>
<para>The NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles (NISP) is developed by the NATO Consultation, Command and Control (C3) Board Interoperability Profiles Capability Team (IP CaT).</para>
<para>The NISP will be made available to the general public as ADatP-34(I) when approved by the C3 Board
<footnote><para>TBD</para></footnote>.</para>
<para>The included interoperability standards and profiles (Volume 2) are <emphasis role="bold">mandatory</emphasis> for use in NATO common funded Communications and Information Systems (CIS).Volume 3 contains <emphasis role="bold">candidate</emphasis><footnote><para>A candidate standard or profile may be mature enough to be used in future programmes after 1 to 2 years.</para></footnote> standards and profiles.</para>
<para>In case of conflict between any recommended non-NATO<footnote><para>ISO or other recognized non-NATO standards organization</para></footnote> standard and relevant NATO standard, the definition of the latter prevails.</para>
<sect1 id="v1-Purpose">
<title>Purpose of the NISP</title>
<para>NISP gives guidelines to capability planners, programme managers and test managers for NATO common funded systems in the short or mid-term timeframes.</para>
<para>The NISP prescribes the necessary technical standards and profiles to achieve interoperability of Communications and Information Systems in support of NATO's missions and operations. In accordance with the Alliance C3 Strategy (ref. C-M(2014)0016) all NATO enterprise<footnote><para>The NATO Enterprise has been identified in C-M(2014)0061</para></footnote> entities shall adhere to the NISP prescribed standards and profiles in volume 2.</para>
<para>Other initiatives, that assure interoperability within the coalition (like TACOMS, MIP, MSA, Archive) may also list their profiles in the NISP.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="v1-Audience">
<title>Intended Audience</title>
<para>The intended audience of the NISP are all stakeholders in the NATO Enterprise, and Allied and Partner nations involved in development, implementation, lifecycle management, and transformation to a federated environment.</para>
<para>There are specific viewpoints, that are mapped to the NISP structure. NISP gives guidelines to:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>capability planners involved in NDPP and NATO led initiatives (like FMN)</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>programme managers for building NATO common funded systems</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>test managers for their respective test events (such as CWIX, CIAV, etc.)</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>national planning and programme managers for their national intiatives</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
<para>Specific NATO or national views to the NISP, based on data export to external planning and management systems are planned to deliver in 2017.</para>
</sect1>
</chapter>
<chapter id="v1c-concepts">
<title>Basic Concepts</title>
<para>With Version 10, basic concepts are adopted to reflect newer developments within NATO. This chapter intends to give an overview to understand the data in volume 2 and volume 3.</para>
<sect1 id="v1c-standards">
<title>Standards</title>
<para>Standards (their content) are defined and managed in their life cycle by standardisation bodies with their own timetable. A standard may have life cycle status like as emerging, mature, fading, or obsolete. Different standardisation bodies use their own lifecylce status definitions. NISP takes lifecyle staus of standards into account, but does not copy them into the NISP database. For aspects of obligation status for standards in planning and programmes, see the next paragraph.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="v1c-stanag">
<title>STANAG</title>
<para>STANAG's are managed by NATO (NSO). Depending on the ratification status, they become mandatory only for NATO funded systems. If NISP references a STANAG, the obligation status for it is only informative. The NSO maintains the obligation status in their own process of standardisation.</para>
<para>Some older STANAG's combine the agreement and the actual specification into one single document. NISP references the specification part.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="v1c-profiles">
<title>Interoperability Profiles</title>
<para>Profiles define the specific use of standards at a service interoperability point (SIOP) in a given mission context. Profiles define prerequesites for programmes or projects and enable interoperability implementation and testing.</para>
<para>Interoperability Profiles provide collections of standards and (sub)profiles for different CIS.</para>
<para>The NISP now defines the <emphasis role="bold">obligation status</emphasis> of profiles and standards as "candidate" or "mandatory". 
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Mandatory</emphasis>: The application of standards or profiles is enforeced for NATO common funded systems in planning, implementating and testing. Nations are invited to do the same nationally to promote interoperabilty for federated systems and services. </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Candidate</emphasis>: The application of profile and standards shall be planned for future programmes. The standard or profile is mature enough to be used  in programmes in 1 to 2 years. This implies, that from a planning perspective, this standard or profile may become mandatory at the time, the programme starts. A candidate standard or profile shall stay in volume 3 no longer than 2 years, unless explicitely marked as an exception to this rule.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Historical</emphasis>: A third status, called "historical" is used only for long term preservation purposes within the database.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>Profiles have to be updated, if referenced standards are changing. Profiles are dynamic entities by nature. NATO captures this dynamic situation by updating profiles once a year in the NISP. Responsible bodies are responsible for the versioning of their profiles. Profiles get refreshed every 2 years by the owners of them to reflect the later life cycle phases.</para>
<para>Proposed profiles (and standards) can be accepted as candidates in order to follow their developments and to decide if they can be promoted to mandatory standards. In some cases proposed standards can be readily accepted directly as mandatory standards.</para>
<para>Interoperability Profiles identify essential profile elements including:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Capability Requirements and other NAF architectural views,</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>characteristic protocols,</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>implementation options,</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>technical standards,</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Service Interoperability Points, and</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>the relationship with other profiles such as the system profile to which an application belongs.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>Interoperability Profiles can contain other Interoperability Profiles to allow for maximal reuse.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="v1s-otherConcepts">
<title>Creating relationships to other concepts and planning objects within NATO</title>
<para>Different initiatives and organisations developed new concepts to govern developments in the interoperability domain. These concepts have logical relation to NISP entities.</para>
<sect2 id="v1s-ABB">
<title>Architecture Building Blocks</title>
<para>TBD</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="v1s-FMNspirals">
<title>FMN Spiral Specifications</title>
<para>Spiral Specifications in FMN define minimal baselines in time to make interoperability working in all aspects in common missions. They are continously developed as spirals and have an defined obligation status for NATO common funded systems.</para>
<para>FMN specifies the spiral specs content with the following parts
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>architecture,</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>instructions,</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>profiles,</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>requirements specifications.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
The part of the profiles are listed in the NISP.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="v1s-CPs">
<title>Capability Packages</title>
<para>Profiles will be referenced in the NISP for specified NATO Common Funded Systems or Capability Packages and may include descriptions of interfaces to National Systems where appropriate.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>
</chapter>
<chapter id="v1c-InfoOrganization">
    <title>Organization of the NISP Information</title>
    <sect1 id="v1s-structure">
    <title>NISP Structure</title>
    <para>In general, systems development approaches suggest a clean line of reasoning from requirements capturing, to architecture, to portfolio planning, to design and build via testing to implementation and utilization and finally to retirement. NISP adresses mainly the phases of portfolio planning, build and test phases of the system lifecycle. NISP data export (planned for 2017) will enable the support of other phases by other management bodies in NATO or nations.</para>
    <para>The structure of the NISP is determined by several factors:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Ease of use of the NISP for planners and programme managers;</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Nature and properties of standards and profiles.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The NISP contains three volumes:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Volume 1</emphasis> - Introduction and Management: This volume introduces basic concepts, provides the management framework for the configuration control of the NISP and the process for handling Request for Change Proposals (RFCP). It includes also guidance on development of interoperability profiles.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Volume 2</emphasis> - Mandatory standards and profiles: This volume lists agreed interoperability standards and profiles, mandatory for NATO common funded systems. These should support NATO and National systems today and new systems actually under procurement or specification.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Volume 3</emphasis>– Candidate standards and profiles: This Volume provides Standards and Interoperability Profiles for programmes to start in 1 to 2 years.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Volume 2 is normative for NATO common funded systems and Volume 3 is informative.</para>

</para>
    <para>The NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) is the primary means to identify the required capabilities and promote their timely and coherent development and acquisition by Allies and Partners. It is operationally driven and delivers various products which could support the development and evolution of more detailed C3 architecture and interoperability requirements. The development of NDPP products also benefits from input by the architecture and interoperability communities, especially the NISP, leading to a more coherent development of CIS capabilities for the Alliance.
More specific information is in an annex.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="v1s-RAs">
<title>NISP APPLICATION TO REFERENCE ARCHITECTURES</title>
<para>The relationship of the NISP and the Reference Architecture effort of Allied Command Transformation is of a mutual and reciprocal nature. The architecture products provide inputs to the NISP by identifying the technology areas that in the future will require standards. The architecture products also provide guidance on the coherence of standards by indicating in which timeframe certain standards and profiles are required.</para>
<para>Architecture Building Blocks</para>
<para>The work on Enterprise, Capability, and programme level architecture will benefit from the NISP by selecting coherent sets of standards for profiles. </para>

</chapter>
<chapter id="v1c-ConfigurationManagement">
    <title>Configuration Management</title>
   <para>The NISP is updated once a year to account for the evolution of standards and profiles. Updates to the NISP are handled through a "Requests for Change Proposal" (RFCP) process, initiated by any stakeholder or 
by specific processes for review purposes, initiated by the IP CaT. </para>
<sect1 id="v1s1-NISP-RFCP">
      <title>REQUEST FOR CHANGE PROPOSAL (RFCP)</title>
      <para>Request for Changes Proposal (RFCP) to the NISP will be processed by the IP CaT, following the process in the graphic below:</para>

<title>National Systems Interoperability Coordination</title>
      <para>Coordination of profiles and standards between Nations and NATO are critical for interoperability. The IP CaT, as the result of the C3 Board sub structure reorganization, does not provide a forum for the statement of national technical efforts. Rather it is up to each of the SMEs represented on the IP CaT to work with national and C3 Board representation to ensure thoughtful coordination of interoperability requirements. As such, each of the IP CaT SMEs is responsible for:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Appropriate and timely coordination of standards and profiles with respect to interoperability with national systems;</para>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
<para>National level coordination of interoperability technical standards and profiles is the responsibility of the C3 Board.  As a result, when the NISP is approved by the C3 Board, the NISP provides national agreement on the NATO interoperability standards and profiles.</para>

    <title>Applicability</title>
    <para>The mandatory standards and profiles documented in Volume 2 will be used in the implementation of NATO Common Funded Systems. Participating nations agree to use the mandatory standards and profiles included in the NISP at the Service Interoperability Points and to use Service Interface Profiles among NATO and Nations to support the exchange of information and the use of information services in the NATO realm.</para>
