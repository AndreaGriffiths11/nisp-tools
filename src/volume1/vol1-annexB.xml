  <title>Configuration Management of NISP</title>

  <sect1 id="v1D-intro">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Updating of the NISP and its associated database will be conducted
    by a managed, rolling review process which will take into account
    information on standards available from a wide variety of sources. The
    NOSWG acts as the hub for this maintenance activity, supported by the
    NHQC3Staff and NC3A personnel as required.</para>

  <sect1 id="v1D-CMorg">
    <title>CM Organization</title>

    <para>For the NISP, authority to act as the Configuration Management Board
    (CMB) lies with C3 CC SC on behalf of the NC3 Board, since this is the
    lowest level at which national endorsement can be given to any proposed
    changes to the NISP contents. The NOSWG acts as the Configuration Control
    Board (CCB), to which all RFCP's must be submitted for evaluation,
    approval and inclusion. In conducting this task, the NOSWG will be
    supported by the NC3A (in technical and procedural considerations) and in
    particular instances by working groups where specific technical advice and
    reference may be required. Thus the CM organisation for the NISP may be
    represented as follows:</para>

    <para>Approval of RFCP's will be coordinated with the responsible subject

  <sect1 id="v1D-1RFCP">
    <title>Request for Change Proposal (RFCP)</title>

    <para>Updates to the NISP are handled through Requests For Change Proposal
    (RFCP). RFCPs are usually reviewed at regularly scheduled NOSWG meetings.
    RFCPs deemed urgent are handled in an expedited manner, outside the normal
    meeting schedule of the NOSWG with a reply to the RFCP originator within
    two weeks. Requests for Changes Proposal (RFCP) to the NISP will be
    processed by the NOSWG following the process outlined in <xref
    linkend="v1D-figRFCP" />.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="v1E1-Coordination">
    <title>Role and Responsibilities of the NC3B Substructure</title>

    <para>The NC3B sub-committees will contribute to the development of the
    NISP in their respective C3 areas of responsibility by responding to the
    RFCP as indicated above. The co-ordination of NISP development effort
    throughout the NC3B sub-structure should be based on the following
    guidance.</para>

    <para>RFCPs are handled at the NOSWG and national levels. The normal
    procedure for handling RFCPs call for the NOSWG to review the status of
    the RFCPs presented at its previous meeting, their content is discussed
    and the NOSWG defines its position with respect to these RFCPs. If the
    RFCP issue is covered by other working groups, these groups must be
    formally requested to provide comments. National representatives may look
    for some additional review of the RFCPs at a national level. Significant
    problems identified in this process should be brought to the attention of
    the NOSWG within a period of eight weeks. The final deadline is however
    the date of the meeting of the final review of the NISP. This period is
    meant to encourage tasking of national experts to verify national
    positions and to co-ordinate with national representatives in other
    working groups.</para>

    <para>The secretaries of the SCs will constitute the primary point of
    co-ordination with the NOSWG, to help the ISSC/NOSWG to obtain the
    adequate support from each SCs working structure;</para>

    <para>In special cases, specific requests for information or even
    questionnaires will be sent to the relevant Committees/WGs, in order to
    receive expert views on specific issues, technologies, or other relevant
    information.</para>

    <para>The NOSWG Chairman (or suitably delegated NOSWG representatives)
    will be available to participate in any SCs or SC/WGs meeting when
    necessary or required.</para>

    <para>RFCPs requiring a response in a more timely manner will be handled
    by the NOSWG outside its scheduled meetings and within a two week period
    from receipt of the RFCP. The NOSWG will use a web based collaboration
    tool, providing a virtual meeting room, to discuss and develop a
    recommendation regarding these urgent RFCPs. The NOSWG recommendation will
    be passed directly to the NC3REPS, via its secretary, for approval by the
    NC3REPS. Once approved by the NC3REPS, the NISP database will be updated
    to reflect the NC3REPS decision.</para>

    <para>The chairman NOSWG will give an annual update to the NC3REPS and all
    Sub-Committees (SC) highlighting the RFCPS handled by the NOSWG
    including:</para>

  <sect1 id="v1D-RESOURCES">
    <title>Resources</title>

    <para>As described above, the CM organisation is dependent on resource
    contributions from NATO and the NATO nations through their participation
    in the various committees and working groups involved in the CM process.
    This support will typically take the form of reviews and submitting RFCPs
    and to exercise the responsibilities of the CMB and CCB.</para>

    <para>As NISP custodian, the NOSWG annually determines the overall update
    task requirement and associated resources necessary for its completion.
    Tasks that will be undertaken by national sources will be initially
    consolidated under the NOSWG. Those that can be more effectively
    undertaken by the NC3A (e.g. specialist technical or procedural support),
    will be endorsed by the NOSWG as part of the NC3A Programme of Work, and
    funded from NC3B resources.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="v1D-BASELINE">
    <title>Baseline</title>

    <para>The rationale for establishing a formal NISP Baseline derives from
    the interdependency of all volumes, and the need to maintain coherence
    throughout their individual and collective content, in particular across
    Volumes 2, 3 and 4.</para>

    <para>When a version of the NISP is considered updated, that is, all
    applicable RFCP's submitted have been actioned, it will be baselined by
    the NOSWG for release to the NC3B and recommended for promulgation to
    NATO. This Baseline applies to the NISP in its entirety, regardless of
    whether any particular volume has been subject to RFCP procedure or not
    since the previous Baseline was issued, and replaces the previous Baseline
    in totality. It signifies a specific point in the update cycle of the NISP
    asdescribed previously.</para>

    <para>Standards and profiles will be maintained in an online database that
    will be updated when approved by the authorized authority.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="v1D-Guidance">
    <title>Request for Change Proposal (RFCP) Guidance</title>

    <para>In order to process any RFCP it is important to provide as much
    information as possible.</para>

    <para>Changes to Volume 4 should outline the key elements of the proposed
    change(s), references to associated documentation and description of
    perceived technology trend (if appropriate). Changes should only be
    proposed in areas where a technology is gaining a broad market acceptance
    and mature product base.</para>

    <para>For Volume 3 requests for new standards will address details such as
    a full specification title, description of applicability, and reference to
    a Web address or other source. Changes to, or deletion, of existing
    component standards will require appropriate support justification.</para>

    <para>Under normal circumstances, changes to Volume 2 will have already
    been reflected in Volume 3, for example a standard possibly proposed as
    maturing from 'emerging' to 'mandatory'.</para>

    <para>Rationale for changes must be adequately supported with
    implementation evidence in order to allow the review process to
    proceed.</para>
