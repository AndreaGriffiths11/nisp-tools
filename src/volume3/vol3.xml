    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>his Volume of the NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles (NISP) is developed by the Interoperability Profiles Capability Team (IP CaT) under the authority the Consultation, Command and Control Board (C3B).  It is expected to be noted by the NATO C3 Board making Volume 3, the guideline for mid-term technology that may be considered for use in future NATO common funded systems. Since the technologies identified in this volume are not expected to be mature for 2 to 10 years, there is significant latitude in the use of the technologies for system design.  Despite the latitude, it should be recognized that the technologies identified in this volume represent the best estimate of the where the state of the art technology is headed.
</para>
    <para>Volume 3 is not populated in this version of the NISP.  The IP CaT is in the process of reviewing the requirements for this volume.  After review, the IP CaT will present to the C3B a plan for the publication of the Volume including the methods for maintaining the quality of the standards noted.</para>
