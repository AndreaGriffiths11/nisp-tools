    <title>NATO Future Mission Network (FMN) Profile of NATO Interoperability
      Standards</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Purpose</title>

    <para>NATO, through its interoperability directive, has recognized that widespread 
    interoperability is a key component in achieving effective and efficient operations.
    In many of the operations world-wide in which NATO nations are engaged, they 
    participate together with a wide variety of other organizations on the ground.
    Such organizations include coalition partners from non-NATO nations, Non-Governmental
    Organization (NGOs - e.g. Aid Agencies) and industrial partners. The NATO Interoperability 
    Standards and Profile (NISP) provides the necessary guidance and technical components
    to support project implementations and transition to NATO Network Enabled Capability
    (NNEC).</para>

<para>The figure below characterizes the information environment and various scenarios that exist for exchanging operational information.  This environment, although rich in participation and basic connectivity, lacks fully meshed interoperability at the services layer.  This diagram represents the AMN environment, and the starting point for future mission network for NATO-led operations.  It is presumed for the purposes of this document that the AMN Profile will only address capabilities between the AMN Core and national AMN extensions.</para>

        </figure>
        

    <para>The purpose of this document is to define an Interoperability Standards 
    Profile to support the Afghanistan Mission Network (AMN) and transition from 
    today's legacy systems to NNEC by defining a useful level of interoperability.</para>
    
    <para>This document will also serve as a resource for NATO C4ISR
    planners, to be used as a guide in achieving interoperability
    between NATO nations, coalition partners and NATO provided
    capabilities.  The AMN Profile is for use throughout the complete
    lifecycle of the ISAF mission.  The AMN Profile will enable Net
    Centric operations by enhancing collaboration across the entire
    operational environment across all levels of command.  Subsequent
    NATO led missions will benefit from the modular nature of the AMN
    Profile, which will allow for maximum reuse of established
    capabilities, while accommodating unique requirements and
    technology improvements.</para>
<para>Coalition Interoperability Assurance and Validation (CIAV) supports the AMN change management process by assessing proposed changes on the Coalition Test and Evaluation Environment (CTE2) replication of the AMN before they are deployed to the operational network.  In the CIAV, all functionalities and interactions can be assured before the upgrades are implemented.</para>

<para>Additional benefits to deployment and sustained operations include:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Speed of execution of operations,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Richer information environment,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>More dynamic information exchange between all members of the network,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Speedier standup of an NATO-led operation,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Reach-back to feature rich information enterprise(s), and</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Elimination of hierarchical information flow.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Participating nations are encouraged to use this document as part of the planning process for coordination and establishment of connectivity and interoperability with respect to joint NATO-led operations.
</para>
    
    <para>This profile will be used in the implementation of NATO Common Funded Systems.
    Nations participating in AMN agree to use this profile at Network Interconnection 
    Points (NIPs) and at other Service Interoperability Points as applicable.</para>

	<para>Nations participationg in the AMN have agreed to comply with the AMN joining instructions. This profile is a technical document that changes more frequently than the joining instructions.</para>
    
    <para>NNEC Services must be able to function in a network environment containing
    firewalls and various routing and filtering schemes; therefore, developers must
    use standard and well-known ports wherever possible, and document non-standard
    ports as part of their service interface. Service developers must assume network
    behavior and performance consistent with the existing limits of these networks,
    taking bandwidth limitations and potentially unreliable networks into account.</para>
    
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Change Management</title>
    
    <para>Applying existing NATO standards or - in those areas where NATO STANAGS
    do not yet exist - International Standards are key for achieving interoperability
    in a federated environment. The dynamic nature of ISAF operations results in
    unforeseen information exchange requirements within and across ISAF. This might
    require the development and design of new data and metadata exchange formats 
    which are not part of current STANAGs and/or Standards. Those ad-hoc formats
    shall be developed in-line with existing NATO policies and guidelines so that
    they can be quickly transformed into standards (e.g. STANAGS) by the appropriate 
    NATO Bodies based on the NATO Bi-SC Data Strategy, the NATO NNEC Data Strategy, 
    and when appropriate, based on the APP-15 process.The AMN Profile is being maintained
    by the AMN Architecture Working Group; it is a living document and is expected 
    to be updated every six months.</para>
    
    <para>ADatP-34 defines four stages within the life-cycle of a standard: emerging,
    mandatory, fading and retired; in those situations where multiple stages are 
    mentioned the AMN Profile recommends dates by which the transition to the next
    stage is to be completed by all AMN members. If a nation decides to implement
    emerging standards it is her responsibility to maintain backwards compatibility
    to the mandatory standard.</para>
    
    <para>Any discrepancies discovered between different elements of this Profile,
    shall be resolved through a change proposal prepared by the responsible NATO
    body or an AMN member nation.</para>
    
    <para>AMN Profile change requests can only be submitted by NATO civil or military
    bodies or AMN member nations.</para>
    
    <para>The AMN Architecture Working Group will review updates to
    ADatP-34, the ISAF Baseline Architecture and AMN Profile change
    proposals and if required will produce a new version of the AMN
    Profile. The AMN profile of the NISP is reviewed by the AMN
    Architecture Working Group (AWG) on a quarterly basis and requests
    for formal adoption by the IP CaT are made by the AWG on a six
    monthly basis.</para>

    <title>Communication Services</title>
      <para>Communications Services interconnect systems and mechanisms for the opaque transfer of selected
        data between or among access points, in accordance with agreed quality parameters and without change
        in the form or content of the data as sent and received. Internet Protocol (IP) technology is the
        enabler of adaptive and flexible connectivity. Its connectionless structure, with its logical 
        connectivity, provides scalability and manageability and is also future-proof by insulating services
        above from the diverse transport technologies below. FMN instances are using a converged IP network
        applying open standards and industry best practices. For Milestone 1 of the FMN architecture the
        interconnection between autonomous systems will be based on IPv4. However, the next evolution (FMN 
        Milestone 2) will be based on IPv6 for interconnecting autonomous systems. Therefore all new 
        equipment, services and applications must support a dual IPv4/IPv6 stack implementation.</para>

          <para>Unified Communication and Collaboration Services provide users with a range of interoperable

            coordination and joint product development.</para>
          <para>Different use cases require different levels of protection of these communication and

          </itemizedlist>
          <para>Depending on the security classification of a FMN instance, Scenario A or B are mandatory.
            If a member choses to use network agnostic Secure Voice services in addition to VoSIP, then 
            SCIP specifications as defined for audio-based collaboration services (end-to-end protected 
            voice) should be used.</para>
          <para>For text-based collaboration there is also a basic profile sufficient for operating
            this service with reduced protection requirements as well as an enhanced XMPP profile 
            that includes additional security mechanisms.</para>

          <para>Geospatial Services deliver network-based access to quality raster, vector 
            and terrain data, available in varying degrees of format and complexity. Geospatial
            Services form a distinct class of information services through their unique 
            requirements for collecting, converting, storing, retrieving, processing, analysing, 
            creating, and displaying geographic data. The generic nature of Geospatial 
            Services - "organizing information by location" - is interdisciplinary and not
            specific to any Community of Interest (COI) or application.</para>

                <entry>WMTS are to be provided as a complimentary service to WMS to ease access to users 
                  operating in bandwidth constraint environments. WMTS trades the flexibility of custom 
                  map rendering for the scalability possible by serving of static data (base maps) where
                  the bounding box and scales have been constrained to discrete tiles which enables the 
                  use of standard network mechanisms for scalability such as distributed cache systems 
                  to cache images between the client and the server, reducing latency and bandwidth use.
