      <title>Common ISDN API (CAPI) v2</title>
      <new-applicability> </new-applicability>
      <applicability>
        The above standards are applicable to systems requiring digital,
        circuit switched services. The ISDN standards cover a telecommunications area
        analogous to the existing voice telephony network but operating digital signalling
        and capable of much higher data rates. ISDN circuits offer the user the ability to
        dial another ISDN user (using ITU-T E.164 ISDN numbering standard) and to use
        the enhanced data capacity in very flexible ways. ISDN is best viewed as a data
        pipeline which, once a connection has been established between two users, may
        operate a variety of protocols and carry all types of data, including voice
        and image. Although ISDN was originally implemented in different ways in Europe
        there is now a standard, Euro-ISDN, created by the European Telecommunications
        Standards Institute (ETSI), to which all European nations have subscribed and
        which now covers most of the population of Europe. The Basic user-network interface
        offers the user two 64kbps 'B' or Bearer channels. These may be used individually
        for conventional data communications or may be grouped together to give an aggregate
        data capacity of 128kbps for applications like restricted video. There is also
        a 16kbps 'D' channel which the ISDN network uses to control the operation of the
        'B' channels. Euro-ISDN specifies the use of 64kbps circuit switching or 3.1kHz
        speech over 'B' channels but will progress to cover X.31 (X.25 over ISDN) over
        'B' and 'D' channels, along with 7 KHz speech. In fact, some European PTTs are
        already offering an X.25 packet switching service to ISDN subscribers based on
        the 'D' channel. The Primary rate user-interface offers the subscriber thirty
        64kbps 'B' channels and, as with the Basic interface, these may be operated
        singly or grouped together to service users at the termination point. The Primary
        rate also features a 64kbps 'D' control channel. Corporate subscribers with more
        than just a small number of users will be more likely to use a Primary rate interface.
        The thirty 'B' channels can aggregate up to a 2.048Mbps connection.

      <new-applicability> </new-applicability>
      <applicability>
        The High Level Architecture (HLA) has been
        developed with the objective of providing a common architecture
        applicable across all classes of simulation to support simulation
        interoperability and reuse. The HLA is defined by the following
        three standards:
        <para>
          Framework and Rules - IEEE Standard P1516: The HLA rules
          describe the responsibilities of federates (simulations, supporting
          utilities, or interfaces to live systems) and federations (sets of
          federates working together to support distributed applications).
          The rules comprise a set of underlying technical principles for the
          HLA. For federations, the rules address the requirement for a
          federation object model (FOM), object ownership and representation,
          and data exchange. For federates, the rules require a simulation object
          model (SOM), time management in accordance with the HLA Runtime
          Infrastructure (RTI) time management services, and certain required
          functionality and constraints on attribute ownership and updates.
        </para>
            <para>
          Federate Interface Specification - IEEE Standard P1516.1:
          In the HLA, federates interact with an RTI (analogous to a
          special-purpose distributed operating system) to establish and
          maintain a federation and to support efficient information exchange
          among simulations and other federates. The HLA interface specification
          defines the nature of these interactions, which are arranged into
          sets of basic RTI services.
        </para>
            <para>
          Object Model Template (OMT) Specification - IEEE Standard
          P1516.2: The HLA requires simulations (and other federates) and
          federations to each have an object model describing the entities,
          not necessarily platform entities, represented in the simulations
          and the data to be exchanged across the federation. The HLA object
          model template prescribes the method for recording the information
          in the object models, to include objects, attributes, interactions,
          and parameters, but it does not define the specific data (e.g.,

        interoperability and reuse. The HLA is defined by the following
        three standards:
        <para>
          Framework and Rules - IEEE Standard P1516: The HLA rules
          describe the responsibilities of federates (simulations, supporting
          utilities, or interfaces to live systems) and federations (sets of
          federates working together to support distributed applications).
          The rules comprise a set of underlying technical principles for the
          HLA. For federations, the rules address the requirement for a
          federation object model (FOM), object ownership and representation,
          and data exchange. For federates, the rules require a simulation object
          model (SOM), time management in accordance with the HLA Runtime
          Infrastructure (RTI) time management services, and certain required
          functionality and constraints on attribute ownership and updates.
        </para>
            <para>
          Federate Interface Specification - IEEE Standard P1516.1:
          In the HLA, federates interact with an RTI (analogous to a
          special-purpose distributed operating system) to establish and
          maintain a federation and to support efficient information exchange
          among simulations and other federates. The HLA interface specification
          defines the nature of these interactions, which are arranged into
          sets of basic RTI services.
        </para>
            <para>
          Object Model Template (OMT) Specification - IEEE Standard
          P1516.2: The HLA requires simulations (and other federates) and
          federations to each have an object model describing the entities,
          not necessarily platform entities, represented in the simulations
          and the data to be exchanged across the federation. The HLA object
          model template prescribes the method for recording the information
          in the object models, to include objects, attributes, interactions,
          and parameters, but it does not define the specific data (e.g.,
          vehicles, unit types) that will appear in the object models.

        The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP),
        developed for use over the Internet, is far more widely used than
        its X.500 equivalent DAP. LDAP support is becoming an integral
        component of a range of user platforms including Microsoft's
        Windows 98 and 2000. It is commonly available for UNIX
        environments as well as for use with X.400 and Internet based
        E-mail systems. LDAP is a variant of the full DAP and was
        originally intended by its creators to provide a lightweight
        complement to full DAP. Whilst DAP is much richer in functionality
        than LDAP, LDAP has gained considerable support in the commercial
        world. A number of vendors have made their proprietary directories
        LDAP-accessible and believe this to be a satisfactory approach for
        many of their customers. However, LDAP remains a simple access
        protocol only, and does not provide the protocols necessary for
        the full Directory service such as will be required by large
        military organisations, (note: this was one of the reasons why
        ACP133 currently mandates DAP). The use of LDAP in military
        systems is still subject to debate as there are both functional
        and security issues to be faced, (e.g. the US Defense Messaging
        System mandates DAP). However, LDAP performs a useful role in the
        provision of simple directory access from end-user

        TCP/IP provides for a reliable, connection-oriented, end-to-end

        and duplicate packets (in OSI terms a type 'C' network). In this, TCP resembles
        the OSI Transport Protocol class 4 (TP4) but major differences exist in features
        like the handling of collisions, addressing format, quality of service, the
        use of user data during set-up of a connection, the handling of 'important data',
        the absence of piggybacking in TP4, kind of message streams, flow control handling,
        window numbering scheme and connection release. TCP also offers some services
        that in OSI are positioned as 'session-layer' services. Associated with TCP is
        a network layer protocol called 'Internet Protocol' or 'IP'. TCP/IP can support
        OSI upper layer applications by employing RFC 2126:1997.

      <title>Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)</title>
      <new-applicability> </new-applicability>
      <applicability>
        BOOTP describes an IP/UDP bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) which allows
        a diskless client machine to discover its own IP address, the address of a
        server host, and the name of a file to be loaded into memory and executed.
        The bootstrap operation can be thought of as consisting of TWO PHASES. This
        RFC describes the first phase, which could be labeled 'address determination
        and bootfile selection'. After this address and filename information is obtained,
        control passes to the second phase of the bootstrap where a file transfer occurs.
        The file transfer will typically use the TFTP protocol, since it is intended
        that both phases reside in PROM on the client. However BOOTP could also work
        with other protocols such as SFTP or FTP.
        <para>
          BOOTP can be used for bootstrapping diskless clients. It can provide
          a client with much more information than just its IP-address, and it can
          be used across routers, obviating the requirement to have a BOOTP server
          on every network. BOOTP runs on top of UDP, and works in conjunction with
          the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) - a much simplified version of
          FTP - that uses UDP. BOOTP will be overtaken by DHCP.
        </para>
            <para>
          Some aspects of the BOOTP protocol were rather loosely defined in its
          original specification. In particular, only a general description was provided
          for the behavior of "BOOTP relay agents" (originally called BOOTP forwarding
          agents"). The client behavior description also suffered in certain ways.
          This memo attempts to clarify and strengthen the specification in these areas.

        documents. For the ODA standard, a document is a structured amount of text,
        graphics, and scanned images, is characterised by its content (logical structure)
        and its internal organisation (layout structure), and can be grouped into a
        document class getting together similar documents such as report, letter, memo.
        <para>
          Part 5 (ODIF) is an ASN.1 based presentation, which specifies the interchange
          format for ODA documents.

        Computer Graphics Metafile is a formal standard defined by ISO/IEC 8632
        and FIPS 128-1. CGM is a computer- and operating system independent interchange
        format. There are elements to represent both geometric graphics content (e.g.,
        circles, polygons) and raster graphics content (e.g., pixel arrays). An element's
        appearance can be affected by attributes (e.g., line cap, line join, mitre limit,
        fill pattern). Several colour models (RGB, CMYK, etc.) are supported. CGM is
        widely used in the publishing industry.
        <para>
          The elements contained in a CGM file represent a wide range of picture
          types. The elements are split into functional groups that delimit major structures:
          (1) define the representations used within the metafile; (2) control the
          display of the picture; (3) perform basic drawing functions; (4) control
          the attributes of the basic drawing actions; and (5) provide access to
          non-standard devices.

          the bit rate significantly below 10 Mbps. At the same time, more audio capabilities,
          such as multiple channels, have been included. The initial MPEG-2 standard

      <new-applicability> </new-applicability>
      <applicability>
        The above standards are applicable to systems requiring digital,
        circuit switched services. The ISDN standards cover a telecommunications area
        analogous to the existing voice telephony network but operating digital signalling
        and capable of much higher data rates. ISDN circuits offer the user the ability to
        dial another ISDN user (using ITU-T E.164 ISDN numbering standard) and to use
        the enhanced data capacity in very flexible ways. ISDN is best viewed as a data
        pipeline which, once a connection has been established between two users, may
        operate a variety of protocols and carry all types of data, including voice
        and image. Although ISDN was originally implemented in different ways in Europe
        there is now a standard, Euro-ISDN, created by the European Telecommunications
        Standards Institute (ETSI), to which all European nations have subscribed and
        which now covers most of the population of Europe. The Basic user-network interface
        offers the user two 64kbps 'B' or Bearer channels. These may be used individually
        for conventional data communications or may be grouped together to give an aggregate
        data capacity of 128kbps for applications like restricted video. There is also
        a 16kbps 'D' channel which the ISDN network uses to control the operation of the
        'B' channels. Euro-ISDN specifies the use of 64kbps circuit switching or 3.1kHz
        speech over 'B' channels but will progress to cover X.31 (X.25 over ISDN) over
        'B' and 'D' channels, along with 7 KHz speech. In fact, some European PTTs are
        already offering an X.25 packet switching service to ISDN subscribers based on
        the 'D' channel. The Primary rate user-interface offers the subscriber thirty
        64kbps 'B' channels and, as with the Basic interface, these may be operated
        singly or grouped together to service users at the termination point. The Primary
        rate also features a 64kbps 'D' control channel. Corporate subscribers with more
        than just a small number of users will be more likely to use a Primary rate interface.
        The thirty 'B' channels can aggregate up to a 2.048Mbps connection.

        Procedure Calls, Multi Media, Presentation (GUI), System Calls,
        specialised Graphic Operations (OpenGL), System Messaging (MAPI),

        functionality is a set of functions to deal with
        Multiprocessing. If WIN32 is used natively, without the subsets,
        it also includes parts of the POSIX.1 functionality; the part of
        WIN32 that deals with POSIX.1 functions is ruled to be POSIX.1
        compliant. That means that a product like Windows 2000, that is
        built with this function, 'can' be ruled POSIX.1 compliant. This
        'does not' mean that WIN32 is POSIX.1 compliant, but allows the
        build up of a POSIX subsystem. To clarify this special aspect of
        WIN32, a product, in this case Windows 2000 will be used as an
        example. Among the requirements, met by Windows 2000, are next to
        portability, multiple processor capability, distributability and
        security compliance with the POSIX.1 standard, Windows 2000
        provides only a POSIX-subsystem. Subsystems are the basic
        architecture elements of Windows 2000. They are servers for the
        system-calls of the application of the specific subsystem. When
        the user starts a POSIX application, WIN32 based Windows 2000
        initiates a new process and passes it to the POSIX-subsystem. The
        program calls a subsystem with a 'Local Procedure Call' by means
        of the POSIX-library - a server 'Demon' that is started up
        together with Windows 2000. The latter translates the calls to
        operating system access. After all an application stays caught in
        its own world, because POSIX-applications cannot place calls to
        the WIN32 subsystems. WIN32 offers over 1500 API's to cover all
        the needs of application developers.

        Telephone and PEN interface API's. Also included in the full WIN32
        functionality is a set of functions to deal with
        Multiprocessing. If WIN32 is used natively, without the subsets,
        it also includes parts of the POSIX.1 functionality; the part of
        WIN32 that deals with POSIX.1 functions is ruled to be POSIX.1
        compliant. That means that a product like Windows 2000, that is
        built with this function, 'can' be ruled POSIX.1 compliant. This
        'does not' mean that WIN32 is POSIX.1 compliant, but allows the
        build up of a POSIX subsystem. To clarify this special aspect of
        WIN32, a product, in this case Windows 2000 will be used as an
        example. Among the requirements, met by Windows 2000, are next to
        portability, multiple processor capability, distributability and
        security compliance with the POSIX.1 standard, Windows 2000
        provides only a POSIX-subsystem. Subsystems are the basic
        architecture elements of Windows 2000. They are servers for the
        system-calls of the application of the specific subsystem. When
        the user starts a POSIX application, WIN32 based Windows 2000
        initiates a new process and passes it to the POSIX-subsystem. The
        program calls a subsystem with a 'Local Procedure Call' by means
        of the POSIX-library - a server 'Demon' that is started up
        together with Windows 2000. The latter translates the calls to
        operating system access. After all an application stays caught in
        its own world, because POSIX-applications cannot place calls to
        the WIN32 subsystems. WIN32 offers over 1500 API's to cover all
        the needs of application developers.

        The security policy of a large enterprise has many elements and many

        department, by Human Resources, by the Legal department and by the Finance department.
        And the policy may be enforced by the extranet, mail, WAN and remote-access systems;
        platforms which inherently implement a permissive security policy. The current
        practice is to manage the configuration of each point of enforcement independently
        in order to implement the security policy as accurately as possible. Consequently,
        it is an expensive and unreliable proposition to modify the security policy.
        And, it is virtually impossible to obtain a consolidated view of the safeguards
        in effect throughout the enterprise to enforce the policy. At the same time,
        there is increasing pressure on corporate and government executives from consumers,
        shareholders and regulators to demonstrate "best practice" in the protection of
        the information assets of the enterprise and its customers. For these reasons,
        there is a pressing need for a common language for expressing security policy.
        If implemented throughout an enterprise, a common policy language allows the
        enterprise to manage the enforcement of all the elements of its security policy
        in all the components of its information systems. Managing security policy may
        include some or all of the following steps: writing, reviewing, testing, approving,

        The security policy of a large enterprise has many elements and many
        points of enforcement. Elements of policy may be managed by the Information Systems
        department, by Human Resources, by the Legal department and by the Finance department.
        And the policy may be enforced by the extranet, mail, WAN and remote-access systems;
        platforms which inherently implement a permissive security policy. The current
        practice is to manage the configuration of each point of enforcement independently
        in order to implement the security policy as accurately as possible. Consequently,
        it is an expensive and unreliable proposition to modify the security policy.
        And, it is virtually impossible to obtain a consolidated view of the safeguards
        in effect throughout the enterprise to enforce the policy. At the same time,
        there is increasing pressure on corporate and government executives from consumers,
        shareholders and regulators to demonstrate "best practice" in the protection of
        the information assets of the enterprise and its customers. For these reasons,
        there is a pressing need for a common language for expressing security policy.

        XSD (XML Schema Definition) specifies how to formally describe
        the elements in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. This description
        can be used to verify that each item of content in a document adheres to the
        description of the element in which the content is to be placed.

          In general, a schema is an abstract representation of an object's
          characteristics and relationship to other objects. An XML schema represents
          the interrelationship between the attributes and elements of an XML object
          (for example, a document or a portion of a document). To create a schema
          for a document, you analyze its structure, defining each structural element
          as you encounter it. For example, within a schema for a document describing
          a Web site, you would define a Web site element, a Web page element, and
          other elements that describe possible content divisions within any page on
          that site. Just as in XML and HTML, elements are defined within a set of tags
