    <document orgid="xmpp" pubnum="xep-0004"  date="2007-08-13" version="2.9" title="Data Forms"/>
    <applicability>his specification defines an XMPP protocol
    extension for data forms that can be used in workflows such as
    service configuration as well as for application-specific data
    description and reporting. The protocol includes lightweight
    semantics for forms processing (such as request, response, submit,
    and cancel), defines several common field types (boolean, list
    options with single or multiple choice, text with single line or
    multiple lines, single or multiple JabberIDs, hidden fields,
    etc.), provides extensibility for future data types, and can be
    embedded in a wide range of applications. The protocol is not
    intended to provide complete forms-processing functionality as is
    provided in the W3C XForms technology, but instead provides a
    basic subset of such functionality for use by XMPP
    entities.</applicability>

    <document orgid="xmpp" pubnum="xep-0012" date="2008-11-26" version="2.0" title="Last Activity"/>
    <applicability>This specification defines an XMPP protocol
    extension for communicating information about the last activity
    associated with an XMPP entity. It is typically used by an IM
    client to retrieve the most recent presence information from an
    offline contact by sending a last activity request to the server

    <applicability>This specification defines an XMPP protocol
    extension for flexible, POP3-like handling of offline
    messages. The protocol enables a connecting client to retrieve its
    offline messages on login in a controlled fashion, without
    receiving a flood of messages. Messages can also be left on the
    server for later retrieval.</applicability>

    <applicability>This specification defines an XMPP protocol
    extension for discovering information about other XMPP
    entities. Two kinds of information can be discovered: (1) the
    identity and capabilities of an entity, including the protocols
    and features it supports; and (2) the items associated with an
    entity, such as the list of rooms hosted at a multi-user chat
    service.</applicability>

    <document orgid="xmpp" pubnum="xep-0045" date="2012-02-08" version="1.25" title="Multi User Chat"/>
    <applicability>This specification defines an XMPP protocol
    extension for multi-user text chat, whereby multiple XMPP users
    can exchange messages in the context of a room or channel, similar
    to Internet Relay Chat (IRC). In addition to standard chatroom
    features such as room topics and invitations, the protocol defines
    a strong room control model, including the ability to kick and ban
    users, to name room moderators and administrators, to require
    membership or passwords in order to join the room,
    etc.</applicability>

    <document orgid="xmpp" pubnum="xep-0060" date="2010-07-12" version="1.13" title="Publish and Subscribe"/>
    <applicability>This specification defines an XMPP protocol
    extension for generic publish-subscribe functionality. The
    protocol enables XMPP entities to create nodes (topics) at a
    pubsub service and publish information at those nodes; an event
    notification (with or without payload) is then broadcasted to all
    entities that have subscribed to the node. Pubsub therefore
    adheres to the classic Observer design pattern and can serve as
    the foundation for a wide variety of applications, including news
    feeds, content syndication, rich presence, geolocation, workflow
    systems, network management systems, and any other application
    that requires event notifications.</applicability>

    <applicability>This document defines an XMPP protocol extension
    for negotiating compression of XML streams, especially in
    situations where standard TLS compression cannot be
    negotiated. The protocol provides a modular framework that can
    accommodate a wide range of compression algorithms; the ZLIB
    compression algorithm is mandatory-to-implement, but

    Standard provides a standard based solution to serve digital maps

    declaration defines the tiles available in each layer (i.e. each
    type of content), in each graphical representation style, in each
    format, in each coordinate reference system, at each scale, and
    over each geographic fragment of the total covered area. The
    ServiceMetadata document also declares the communication protocols
    and encodings through which clients can interact with the

    <applicability>The OpenGIS Web Feature Service Interface Standard
    (WFS) defines an
    interface[http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/glossary/i] for
    specifying requests for retrieving geographic features
    [http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/glossary/g] across the Web
    using platform-independent calls. The WFS standard defines
    interfaces and operations for data access and manipulation on a
    set of geographic features, including: • Get or Query features
    based on spatial and non-spatial constraints • Create a new
    feature instance • Get a description of the properties of features
    • Delete a feature instance • Update a feature instance • Lock a
    feature instance The specified feature encoding for input and
    output is the Geography Markup Language (GML)
    [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml] although other
    encodings may be used. </applicability>

    <applicability>The OpenGIS® Filter Encoding Standard (FES) defines
    an XML encoding for filter expressions. A filter expression
    logically combines constraints on the properties of a feature in
    order to identify a particular subset of features to be operated
    upon. For example, a subset of features might be identified to
    render them in a particular color or convert them into a
    user-specified format. Constraints can be specified on values of
    spatial, temporal and scalar properties. An example of a filter
    is: Find all the properties in Omstead County owned by Peter
    Vretanos. This standard is used by a number of OGC Web Services,
    including the Web Feature Service
