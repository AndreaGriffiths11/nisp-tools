More on profiles

   A "newstandard" defines one (standard which may consists of parts)

   A profile (standard) is defined as a subset of a standard, multiple
   standards, a configureation of a standard/profile (Leassonslearned
   from CWIX). A profile contains references to a standard,
 
   A profile may be recursively defined. Is TACOMS 2000 an example of this?
 

   How do we define services?

   Should we have service profiles? I think so.

   How do we version profiles / services / service profiles
