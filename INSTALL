Installation Notes for the NISP XML tools

$Id$

System Requirements
-------------------

1. Java

  - Install the Java Software Develoment Kit 1.4.2_06 or newer,
    avalible from http://java.sun.com

  - Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME the the location of the
    Java Distribution

  - Add the Java bin directory to the PATH environment variable

2. The NISP XML tools

   - Install the NISP tools distribution anywhere (Window95/98 and
     Window ME user should unpack the distribution in a directory with
     a very short path - This is due to a well-known bug in the
     command shell)

     It is recommended that you do not install the tool in the same
     directory as a previous version of the tool package 

   - Set the environment variable NISP_HOME to the location of the
     NISP tools distribution
    

3. The NISP XML source

   - In the tools distribution, there is an empty directory called
     src. Unpack the NISP XML sources here

4. Updating the Stylesheets (also relevant for the NISP tool package) 

   Since the release of version 3.0 of the nc3ta-tools distribution, 
   (nc3ta-tools-3.0.zip), an additional package package have been released, 
   which only contains the stylesheets. The name of the package will by 
   default be nc3ta-xsl-3.0.rev0.zip.

   N.B. NOTE THAT THE nc3ta-xsl-x.y.rev0.zip IS PART OF THE
   nc3ta-tools-x.y.zip PACKAGE.

   Whenever a modification to the stylesheets (including an update of the 
   DocBook XSL stylesheets) is released. This new version could e.g. be named 
   nc3ta-xsl-3.0.rev1.zip.

   This enables us frequently release new and potentially experimental 
   versions of the stylesheet, and when required, we can return to the 
   original stylesheets.
